mmik2x0,1jwi4cm,t3_1jwi4cm,"I've tried sharing this with friends - especially those getting engaged - but most still insist on buying mined diamonds kasi baka daw magalit fiance nila.


When I mentioned it to some titas, a few even got offended. They couldn't accept the idea that their prized collections might be nearly worthless.


They'd rather believe there's value than face the truth. I've stopped bringing it up since it feels like I'm stepping on something too personal.

mmio9ai,1jwi4cm,t3_1jwi4cm,"Pawnshops will always drag down the price. I was in the same boat with my mother's jewelry spending, and we had them appraised and eventually graded (GIA for the good ones, any other available labs for the average ones - IGI, AGS? Etc.).

Can you send set diamonds (set meaning already placed in jewelry) for grading? - No. You have to take them out for grading.

Are loose diamonds more expensive than set jewelry? - No. Set jewelry is more expensive but the market is leaning towards buying loose then having them set to their preferred design. 

Our final steps:
1. Sold the gold (yellow, white, etc.) - look at the global index. A lot of websites available. Sell when the price is right. People will buy at 80% of market value which we bought our gold at way cheaper than today's 4k+/g pricing.

2. Sold the good graded gems for a profit. Consigned some to reputable live sellers, others sold to friends. 

3. Sold some of the average gems to jewelers for those that require multiple stones (think eternity rings, tennis bracelets)

4. Re-set some of the gems para may natira padin sa mother ko for sentimental purposes

After the process, we sold them and got +10% profit. (Net of transportation and grading costs). This was good considering my mom's knowledge of diamonds was limited to the shine but yellow diamonds (H grade and below) can still shine in the right settings. 

Overall learning:
-Yes, diamonds are still investments
-Selling jewelry is hard work
-Research research research
-Credibility is key for jewelry sales so your knowledge, the grading certificates, etc. Will factor in to the final price. 

I suggest you dive more into the trade than pawning it out for easy money. Considering the urgency, you may consider selling the lower pieces. Sayang din yung money invested by your parents. Kaya yan gawan ng paraan with some research and finding the right leads.

I did this with minimal help from my fam. Finished the process in almost a year. Sana kayanin mo din. Good luck!",49

Kaya if you really like diamonds better 1 of each kind na lang (1 pair earrings, 1 ring, 1 necklace and 1 bracelet). Then when you have na buy pure gold na. Yung walang stones kasi nakakababa talaga ng value. In my experience naman, gold helped my parents way back. Pag kinakapos, sangla tapos pag nagka budget tinutubos din nila.

mmj34bn,1jwi4cm,t3_1jwi4cm,"Hello OP!

I had our diamonds sold at a reputable store at Greenhills, Sucheri. They're literally 30+ years na but they don't like advertising themseves. They're the IFYKYK. 

Sold a set for 2.5 M that my grandmother bought before (2 years ago). Please note these are Flawless NATURAL diamonds Emerald cut. Other than that, these stones don't have GIA certificates as well. They will buy it if its HIGH QUALITY. 

Tip on reselling jewelries: please go to reputable stores who are not just selling jewelries. Owner/Auntie is a GIA graduate so she obviously knows her deal.

Do not sell to some random pawnshop because they literally do not know how to value these items. 

Also, alot of people ""Gold"" jewelry online pero GOLD COATED lang pala. 

Please please buy from reputable stores that sell SOLID GOLD 14k or 18k. Super dami nagbebenta ng fake jewelries saying its 14 or 18k. Dami nauuto.",14

mmiodum,1jwi4cm,t3_1jwi4cm,"years ago when we were in dire financial situation, we brought all of inay's jewelries sa pawnshop and boy, it was an eye opener for us na first time pumunta sa sanglaan, i was in third year college then.

1. pass sa mga may bato. walang value ang bato sa sanglaan

2. we brought so much jewelries kasi kala namin 2k lang masasanla bawat isa e need namin mga 30k at that time final computation, minus the ones na may mga bato, umabot ng 100k. nagulat kami, sabay bawi nung ibang alahas.

it was a fun din, dami naming natutunan. natuwa ang inay kasi yung ibang nabili nya tumaas na ng 75% na yung value.

extra: totoo ba yung nagkikiskis sila? isinanla ko kasi ule yung isang bracelet na nasanla ko dati tapos tinanong ako kung sinanla ko na before kasi ""nakiskis daw"" sabi ko ""opo sa inyo rin, sa ibang branch nga lang"". di na nagsalita si ate",12

mmillpj,1jwi4cm,t3_1jwi4cm,"Thanks for sharing this warning. I wanted to buy some jewelry just for personal use pero yan rin ang concern ko, baka peke ang mabili ko lalo kung hindi ako bumili sa ""proper"" na jewelry stores at sa mga individuals lang. But I'm against using jewelry as emergency fund, iba pa rin ang merong cold hard cash na mawi-withdraw sa bank in times of need kasi it takes away the hassle na magbenta-benta pa. I have a feeling that there's not a lot of people sharing yung ganitong issue na naranasan mo, baka ang crowd na may mahilig sa jewels eh yun wala pa sa reddit.

Also these pawnshops, since they are a business and they need to make money it makes sense for them to buy pieces at very low price para kumita sila. Similar sa nagbenta ka ng used phone sa mga cellphone repair, mas mababa pa ang asking price kesa kapag sa rate ng marketplace if you sell them as an individual.",10

m97hm9o,1i9wte3,t3_1i9wte3,"Just to add: smaller politicians (like congressman/woman) have funds only for specific hospitals. For example, yung congressman namin ay may funds sa PCMC at Heart Center, pero wala sa East Ave Medical. Kapag wala silang pondo sa ospital mo, they cannot provide a GL. And usually, para makakuha ng GL ay dapat may quotation na kayo from the hospital magkano aabutin, and they will input the exact amount on the letter (to the centavo), para saktong sakto sa pinasa mong quotations. If for any reason hindi mo nagamit lahat (e.g., may isang procedure na nabayaran mo na), pwede mong magamit yung remaining funds para sa ibang procedure na accepted ang GL (usually X-ray, lab works, simple tests). Also, may mga ospital na may sariling GL, such as sa PCMC, nagbigay sila ng GL dati for complete dental rehab, and from their own funds ito nanggaling. DSWD also offers cash if you opt for it (papipiliin if GL or cash, if cash then same-day ng pila binibigay).

Also note that most organizations/govt agency na nagbibigay ng GL ay pwede kayong mai-recommend ng ospital nyo directly, para maging secured yung pagpunta nyo ron. If endorsed kayo ng ospital, most likely magiging successful ang pagkuha nyo ng GL, tulad sa OVP at DSWD. Hanapin nyo lang yung social service ng ospital nyo, at magtanong kayo paano process nila.

This is based on personal experience, and may vary depending on your location/hospital/LGU.",3

But basically in Davao, as long as you are in the public hospital, all you need to do is to go to the malasakit center and apply for assistance, they will basically take care of your bills. Zero-zero is a very popular term here in davao.

To emulate that nationwide they needed to give more funds to Phil health to drive malasakit centers. My cousin in manila who hates duts experienced the zero-zero experience in public hospital in Pasay during his term. (She was happy with it but still doesn't like him lmao)

Kaya ayun, ginawa ko, may notebook ako noon na nakalista lahat ng nabili at cash ba kinuha. Tapos ako na yung nag manage na dapat hindi lalagpas sa kita ang kukunin na pera.

On TCT: Owners keep the original owner’s copy of the title. If the property is bought via mortgage, it is very likely the original owner’s copy of TCT is kept by the bank/lender and will process the annotation in the title with RD to record collateral. When the mortgage is fully paid, the bank/lender will give back the original owner’s copy and notarized cancellation of mortgage. There’s only one original owner’s copy. When you verify with the Registry of Deeds, they will just issue you a certified true copy of the TCT. CTC TCT are always dated so you will know if it is a recent copy or not.",60

How is it costliest?

You must also do due diligence in checking the current zonal value of the property. Also, if you're a buyer, it's safer to issue a separate check for the payment of CGT. This should not be in the name of the current owner but to BIR directly. This ensures that the CGT will actually get paid and no issues on the transfer of title eventually.

m2u1217,1hhue7g,t3_1hhue7g,VUL = fund your “fa” his/her next travel 😂,165
m2v3fwd,1hhue7g,t3_1hhue7g,"VUL sounds good in paper pero not in a way advisors glorify it. Because sometimes mismong advisor di nila gets yung small print ng pinepresent nila.

May tatlong uri ng advisor, 
Advisor 1 are actually deceitful they know pero di nila sinasama sa explanation.
Advisor 2 are the baguhan. Di nila truly gets pero they explain it on how they are told.
Advisor 3 are the ethical ones. They won't sell to you products na hindi sila personally convinced.

Don't get me wrong, I also don't like or recommend VULs. I got one when I was younger kasi nasilaw din sa potential earnings, although naexplain naman ng advisor ko ng maayos.

Here's just a few more clarification and also agreement in your points


1. Malaki ang commission ng financial advisor

This one is true, malaki ang commission ng advisor sa first year payment. Pero don't take it as binubulsa nila ang pera mo, you pay it directly sa company and company ang magbibigay sa advisor.  Makikita mo sa proposal na malaki ang charges on the first three years compared sa mga susunod. Which is supposed to be shown and explained during proposal.


2. Ang daming charges:

True. Most charges are not specifically listed down and ang stated in the proposal na binibigay could be actual charges or estimates. Pero since VUL, estimated charges niyan. 
Example is yung nakuha ko. 
36000 a year ang payment. Charges for 1st year: 25k. Charges for 2nd year: 19k. Charges for 3rd year: 13k. 
Charges for 4th year: 9k. Charges for 5th year: 8k. And so on. Pero on the fine print: ""Charges based on 4% investment return"". Which means magbabago siya depende sa performance ng investment. (Hinanap ko talaga lumang proposal na binigay para basahin ulit.)


3. Kapag tumigil ka sa hulog, goodbye pera mo. 

This one is both TRUE and FALSE.
Dito actually pumapasok ang advantage ng VUL. Since may investment part, as long as may fund value ang account mo, buhay ang plan mo kahit hindi ka makapagbayad ng ilang months. Pero of course, pag nasimot na yung fund value, dyan na papasok yung TRUE. Goodbye na sa payments mo.
Yung VUL ko nakuha ko ng 2021. Kumpleto ako for the 1st year and half nung next year sa payment kaso nawalan ako ng work so binabayaan ko na. Chineck ko this 2024, buhay pa rin. Nilalagyan ko na lang siya pag paubos na yung fund value para buhay yung insurance. Pero di na ko nageexpect sa investment part.



4. Walang guarantee kapag nalugi ang fund.

This one is just actually how investment works. There's no guarantee on the returns. Ang ipapakita sa inyo sa proposal is 0% 4% or 8%. Pero it can go lower.

----

And also to note yung minimum years to pay, estimated lang din yun. May chance na magextend pa if pangit ng performance ng investment.


Kaya maraming nabablindside because hindi pinapaliwanag yung important details like
""Projected Benefits"" - yung pinapakita na kikitain mo raw is example lang kung ganun ang performance ng investment pero most often hindi naman ganun kataas ang actual return.
""Riders"" - mga addons na nakakadagdag sa charges pero you have the option to actually remove.
And most importantly minamarket siya as investment when in fact ang priority ng VUL is life insurance which is kumakain ng pera.


Which is why hindi practical ang VUL. Investments is supposed to grow your money pero dinedrain nung insurance charges. So it's best to get them separately.


At the end of the day, make sure to fully understand before you commit into anything. Kahit gaano pa kapleasing ang pagkaexplain sa inyo. 
You'll find other better products to suit your life.",123
m2u76j1,1hhue7g,t3_1hhue7g,"Tatlong beses na ako na bigyan ng offer sa bank. Everytime I ask how much ang charges and other fees and when kakaltas natatahimik ang agent. I told her, my MP2 and UITF accounts have earnings that is more than what you are ""projecting"" so why will I bother to inconvenience myself with all your papers works to earn less?. So now smile nalang kami everytime I visit the bank. Wala nang attempt to sell to me. Hahaha.",39

I don’t think they realize na bad optics yun, and more on parang panghikayat sya to join their team of insurance sellers and hindi wise spending.",16
m2twsrg,1hhue7g,t3_1hhue7g,"Ang problema sa VUL is yung mga agent na nagsisinungaling pra lng makabenta. 

Another problem nman yung mga kumkuha na hindi ngbabasa ng contract plus iniintindi tlga yung kinukuha nila.

Hindi ka nlugi ng more than 50%. Nabayad ka ng insurance mo..dun napunta yun. Kung my nangyari sayo ang mkkinabang at may mkukuha pera yung family mo. Yun ang insurance.

Hndi savings account yung VUL or any insurance. Expense yun. 

Having said that, hindi din tlaga advisable VUL.",114

m2u26v3,1hhue7g,t3_1hhue7g,"Share ko lang experience ko. I opted for VUL in 2011 payable for 20 yrs mainly because I wanted an insurance. Bonus lang yung investment part and I guess during that time (I was 26 then), all I wanted was to be insured because I was a breadwinner. Fast forward now, 13 years later, my total investment value is more than USD 34k (total contribution is USD 31.6k). I have read so many negative reviews about VUL but I still continued paying because its the insurance I’m after. If after 20years and nothing happens to me, I can withdraw and hopefully, it has gained even a bit. I guess my point is, some people opt for a product that fits their purpose. if it didnt work you, does not mean it will not work for all.

I have also separate life and health insurances, stocks, reits, and real estate investments.",106

m2tyesh,1hhue7g,t3_1hhue7g,VUL is an insurance. Full stop. I don't think may mali sa product kasi may mga taong ok sa ganyang scheme. Scammer vibes lang talaga 'yung agents and they should stop calling themselves financial advisor kasi 'yan lagi ang ibebenta nila sa 'yo dahil malaki nga komisyon. Nakalaya na rin ako sa ganyan buti na lang may crypto para mabawi man lang capital. Kaya cringe na ko sa kakilala ko kung maka-post ng conferences at travel incentives. Lol.,48

m2x2mwa,1hhue7g,t3_1hhue7g,"Ang amazing pa is hindi mo na macontact ang ""financial advisor"" once they secured the policy. Makikita mo na lang sa socmed, may mga award na sila na best agent something for the month for having 1 million insured something something. May mga letra pa yan sa dulo ng pangalan nila to the tune of Million Dollar Round Table (try searching MDRT hahahha). May mga pa-travel the world pa yan. lol. I don't hate them for what they're doing, very paradoxical lang talaga to me. They're supposed to help their clients live a financially-sound life, pero parang mas hirap na hirap pa si client to balance the finances with the VUL payments, habang sila ay patuloy na nagrerecruit ng mga agents to increase their value and enjoy the 'benefits' of being an agent. 

It became more about the ""FA"" career na with all its perks, not about the essence of the job na maassist ang mga consumer on insurance. Case-in-point, I asked my agent about term and whole life insurance lang, nawalan ng gana, di na nagreply. Nung finollow up ko, ininsist na mas maganda pa rin ang VUL. Like gurl! I did my own research already and I know what I want. And they will flood you with templates showing why VUL is the better investment. Another case, I asked my agent about BTID, so she could help me decide, she hadn't heard of it. K.

It's a messed up system, imho.",8

I wish some lawmaker is smart enough to outlaw this product. Im sure it has ruined that lives of many. Yes it has uplfited the lives of these “FA” but at the cost of the savings of many others.

However, prior to her asking me, I already read the contract of a friend that has a VUL. As mentioned here, the admin fees and insurance payment doesn't stop until the policy is enforced, meaning you die. If the fund or investment doesn't earn enough to cover those, your fund value will slowly be eaten up. The way I see it, you are just asked to advance your insurance payment and admin fees within 10 yrs.",6

This is a problem that comes and goes. It goes, in moments like these, when people go “holy shit I can’t handle any more humble brag, low-effort posts!”.

I wrote the original rule two years ago, and spent many months viciously applying it to people who, upon a private chat, were not out to humble brag, but who were apologetic for posting and just looking for guidance in a confusing, high-stakes activity.

Slowly, I began to allow exceptions for posts that appeared to ask genuine strategic questions, and weren’t just for the purpose of seeing their own salary slobbered over by phinvest redditors.

Still, some of the offending posts still generated huge responses before we could get rid of them, and reading through some of those posts, it was obvious that there was a productive exchange of strategic financial information.

On some level, it comes down to a mod team’s default setting: err on the side of deletion and rigid rule application, or err on the side of restraint and a more judicious application of the rules that apply more to the spirit of a post rather than to its specific form.

We've tried to allow the greatest spread of information within our rules.

The sub has grown a lot, and the more things change, the more things are kind of the same. The same problems crop up. The proliferation of these kinds of posts overwhelming /u/treeperfume is what prompted me to become a mod. The overwhelming of me is what prompted /u/speqter to become a mod.

Maybe the answer isn't so much that we need new rules and new approaches, as it is we just need more mod eyes on the posts to help us tighten up the discussion a bit?

Should we head in that direction first (adding additional mods to trim/prune posts), and circle back in a bit to see if that helps push the ship in a better direction?",20
iom10tw,xf2dhp,t3_xf2dhp,"Sorry sa mga tatamaan from /r/ph pero sa totoo lang some of the posts here seem fictional to them because they can't imagine that some people are actually earning 6-8 digits monthly especially when you're only in your 20s. Of course it will seem fictional to some especially para dun sa mga tao na tumanda na lang kakatrabaho e minimum wage earner pa din.

The reality is despite getting the opportunities to earn huge amounts of money some people are still unsure how to properly handle their finances. Ability to make money != Ability to manage money. Magkaibang magkaiba yun. I know some people who earn mid to high 6 digit salaries and still live paycheck to paycheck because they never knew how to manage their finances especially those who grew up poor and were never taught any money management skills. 



Now, I'm not discounting the possibility that maybe some of the posts made here are fictional and that some people here seem harsh when commenting on other people's financial situations but hey it's an investment focused sub and it would always attract people who value money and its proper management highly and to those who are financially irresponsible these people would always seem fictional and harsh.

Tbh to me those posts from the other sub reek of inggit and insecurity. Meron nga ako nabasa nag unsub daw dito dahil pag nakikita nya sweldo ng mga mas bata sa kanya na IT devs nalulugmok sya and nadedepress. Anong tawag dun? 

Also regarding posting figures of your salary and portfolio, it's not bragging if it's real and it is related to your question. Imagine asking if you can afford to buy a house and only saying that you're earning ""sakto lang nakakaipon naman kahit papano kada buwan"" instead of ""i earn 200k net monthly""

If someone wanted to live on the land, (usually distant relatives), they were allowed as long as only one family stayed and only one house was built. In return, they had to maintain the property. If someone else moved in or built another house, they all had to leave. If their children would claim ownership once they've passed and wanted them out then they’d have to go.

To keep things clear, my grandparents had everything written down and signed by a lawyer and both parties. So far, everyone has followed the deal. Hindi naman sila dumami na parang kabute.",6

lr9c39t,1g0iz4y,t3_1g0iz4y,"I love how you know your numbers and the insights to your business. If more entrepreneurs do business this way the better off they will be. Your main job now as entrepreneurs is to build a brand. A brand is not just a logo or tagline, it is a promise that you make to your customers. A brand makes them feel a certain way about your business. Since you're in a salon business, I think they should feel more beautiful after they walk out of your salon than when they went in. If you can consistently deliver on that, later on you will gain their loyalty and can command a better price. It is really hard for a business to fail if it can consistently delight its customers.

As to your people problem, you have to address it head on. Resentment and envy being part of the culture are dangerous. Talk to your people why they feel that there's favoritism. You might see it as something trivial, but those feelings always came from something that might be important to them. It's always better to be clear than clever when giving directions and expectations. Have a good incentives program to your people. Incentives are very powerful in aligning their interest to yours so think of it carefully and use it wisely.

And lastly, hire slow, but fire fast. Having the right people that fits into the culture that you would want in your business will save you from a lot of headaches.",19

1. Referral discounting - which hit maintaining and adding new customers, di ko kasi alam among those customers ilan yung pumapasok na besty sila or mommy/daughter but it works like if you have a besty/daughter with you or any condition that will require them to bring one more to get discount or atleast a referral from the existing customer.

2.Service guarantee - ""this strat works like if the promised treatment time is delayed then you will have this"" of course you'll always be delayed so you need to give something but you already accounted for it in your general pricing.

3. Sensory marketing - if you could find ways to make the salon smell/look something unique or relaxing. esp dying agent might have strong smell. https://estetify.pl/en/blog/sensory-marketing-in-a-beauty-salon.

I'm in a different industry so idk some of the nitty gritty of salon business just my opinion that might improve sales.

m8sluwe,13vc18u,t3_13vc18u,"Still advocates for living frugally properly. Honestly, nagkaroon ako ng lifestyle inflation but it's a lifestyle inflation that benefited me. I bought a car, i rented my own place and I travelled once or twice a year out of the country.

Alam mo it made my headspace clearer and mas magaan sa mental health ko. Di ako naniniwala sa delayed gratification ng ilang years, kasi tinry ko na and it is not for me. Ang bigat sa pakiramdam bawat araw that I needed to work tapos down na down yung mental health ko. Mas productive ako nung di ako nagdelayed gratification. Mas madami din savings ko at mas malaki nadadagdag sa EF ko kapag ganun hahahaha

My idea of living frugally is to spend what you can, di ko titipirin pero i make sure it is of good quality at pangmatagalan ko gagamitin. That way, i don't have to palit yearly ng gamit, maybe 5 years yeah. So kung may low quality at highest quality, kapag mas malaki ang lamang ng high quality at a comfortable price i go for it. Pero kung may mid price that will satisfy what i need, dun ako mostly. Never the cheap ones na di mo subok ang tibay kasi di mo sure baka next year need na naman bumili ng bago. I don't buy way above my means, lalo na kung di kailangan. I cook my own food (ang laking tipid nito) tsaka kung may travel coming up mas iniistretch ko yung pwedeng gawing pagkain na galing ref. Kung may extra aside sa net kong income and savings, half lang nun ang allowed kong gastusin (pero dahil nga wala ako masyadong guilty pleasure o gustong bilhin dahil nga di naman down ang mental health ko, i end up not even using most of it so napupunta siya sa savings sa travel). 

Ayun, i end up saving 50% of my income kahit may lifestyle inflation na at may gusto akong bilhin vs nagdelayed gratification ako tapos 30% lang nagiging savings ko. But this is just me.

PS.
Isa pang tip ko, lagi ko pinapalabas na wala akong pera para di ako utangan hahahahaha di narin ako masyado nagsosoc med masyado para di ako imessage ni mars hahahahahaha",1

The post was Be Pragmatic, so I gave some pragmatic advice, which almost anyone to some degree can follow. I'm not a financial expert and not trying beating inflation, but maybe it can help.

It seems some people want more radical solutions. Here's what worked for us. Your situation may differ, and this may or may not work for you.

1) Never apply for jobs that are too far from home. Apply for work within your town and city. Better, work from home. An alternative is to apply for work that has housing.

2) Avoid red meat. Eat grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, and chicken. If your workplace offers lunch and dinner, eat more at work, and fast at home.

3) Avoid marrying and having children early. Save first, then marry and have children later, or not at all.

4) Never get a credit card. If you have a credit card, always pay your credit card balance in full.

5) Avoid debt. If you cannot pay something in full or in cash, do not buy it. You cannot afford it.

6) Build or increase your emergency fund. If your fund can support 3-6 months of no work, build it to support 6-12 months.

A lot of my advice is to avoid costs in the long run. It's what I call defensive living.

I'm not sure what advice to give someone who risked a lot, such as getting married and having children early, acquiring debt for their business, etc. Maybe the advice for them is to focus on building their business and their family so they can be productive. Maybe instead of defensive living, they can try offensive living and seek as many opportunities as they can. All the best!",49

The tips that you have mentioned are to encourage you on how to think creatively in order to have it. The tips are the goal and how you get there is up to you.

1. Increase Your Income

I also had a 9 to 5 job before and was earning 13K a month (WTF). I wake up at 6AM then come home at 8PM. I can't possibly have time to do another hustle, Diba? So ung ginawa ko, nag resign ako and applied sa BPO. My working hour then became from 4AM to 1PM!! NOOOOWWWWW Meron na akong oras from 2PM onwards to do side hustle (Plus I earn more on my day job) Ayos! 2 birds with one stone.

Nung tumaas na ung income ko, nakaipon ng onti, I found an opportunity! May nakita ako na fully furnished condo na worth 15k/month. I decided to rent it and list it sa Airbnb. Hired a part-time HRM student and I'm paying her P500/guest to clean my unit. Nakatulong na ako sa student, MORE INCOME PA without me wasting time. That unit is earning positive ROI para sakin. This, plus my side hustle (web design) SHIT! MORE INCOME ULIT!!

2. Track Your Expenses and Reduce Expenses

Simula nung tumaas income ko dahil sa side hustles ko, mas naging applicable na ung dalawang tips na to. Hindi porket tumaas na ung income eh I have to increase my lifestyle as well. Madaling sabihin diba? Pero eto ung pinakamahirap gawin!! Kasi kahit na gaano kataas ung income mo, pero tumataas din expenses mo eh bali wala lng din. So, Increase your income while maintaining your lifestyle (taas mo ng konti para maging comfortable lifestyle naman)

One thing I also noticed when tracking expenses is makikita mo ung mga tiny purchases na hindi naman kailangan. In my case are (Spotify subscription, Lotto tickets, Special sa pag sakay ng tike (walking is healthy anyway), buying coffees (I now brew my own coffee, mas mura pala sya), street foods, and more. So, tinangal ko na. I can live without it.

I was also become aware of my spending habbits. I spend more sa mga bagay that earns me money (Investing is beating inflation) pero right now, more on mutual funds ako (wala na akong time to do market research, kaya perfect ang mutual funds) OH SHIT, More income ulit without wasting too much time!!!.

So,

It may seem common sense, yes, pero paano mo gawin un requires creativity. Always look out for opportunities. The system is NOT DESIGNED to keep you at the bottom. Kasi if it is, edi sana we don't hear about people na ""rags to riches diba""?

Also beating the inflation was meant sa savings mo sa bank or paper money na hawak mo. It would be better to invest them.

These guys meant no harm, yes, totoo but this post will harm more Filipino.

Bonus tip: Have your wisdom teeth removed when needed. Visit your dentist a month after your last COVID-19 shot and have your mouth x-rayed. When your dentist says you have abnormal teeth that needs to be removed then do so. Better to lose your wisdom teeth (3rd molar) than your 2nd and 3rd molar. It's more expensive to remove both and get implants.

[FRIED CHICKEN WITH 11 HERBS AND SPICES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC_Original_Recipe)

Prep: 30 minutes

Soak: 20-30 minutes

Cook: 15-18 minutes

Makes: 4 servings

2 cups all-purpose flour

2/3 tablespoon salt

½ tablespoon dried thyme leaves

½ tablespoon dried basil leaves

1/3 tablespoon dried oregano leaves

1 tablespoon celery salt

1 tablespoon ground black pepper

1 tablespoon dried mustard

4 tablespoons paprika

2 tablespoons garlic salt

1 tablespoon ground ginger

3 tablespoons ground white pepper

1 cup buttermilk

1 egg, beaten

1 chicken, cut up, the breast pieces cut in half for more even frying

Expeller-pressed canola oil

1. Mix the flour in a bowl with all the herbs and spices; set aside.

2. Mix the buttermilk and egg together in a separate bowl until combined. Soak the chicken in the buttermilk mixture at room temperature, 20-30 minutes.

3. Remove chicken from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off. Dip the chicken pieces in the herb-spice-flour mixture to coat all sides, shaking off excess. Allow to sit on a rack over a baking sheet, 20 minutes.

4. Meanwhile, heat about 3 inches of the oil in a large Dutch oven (or similar heavy pot with high sides) over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. (Use a deep-frying thermometer to check the temperature.) When temperature is reached, lower the heat to medium to maintain it at 350. Fry three or four pieces at a time, being careful not to crowd the pot. Fry until medium golden brown, turning once, 15-18 minutes. Transfer chicken pieces to a baking sheet covered with paper towels. Allow the oil to return to temperature before adding more chicken. Repeat with remaining chicken.",18

h71o7og,oqk0f2,t3_oqk0f2,"This is exactly what I told my Fiancé 7 years ago. I was only able to start my PruLife Insurance after getting hired to a different job with a higher pay. I could have lived with what I was earning and maybe saved a little before I made the job switch, if only I wasn't sharing almost half of what I earn to my mother. 

I even told my Fiancé if I don't have any family I would be living a more comfortable life because it would be easier to provide for myself alone. But don't get me wrong, it's nice to have a family, but mine is so problematic that sometimes I only wish I don't have one. 

I thought I was way past the financial struggles, but lo and behold, come 2020, I was forced to not only support my mother and my younger brother, but 2 of my other siblings as well. This is because they quit their job at the start of COVID cases here in PH. So I was forced to extend my help to them as well, and I really got nothing left for me. It was so stressful since I was also thinking of quitting my job before the ECQ, but had to stay and shoulder on for my siblings and my mother. Things are getting better so far, since my sisters have started working again and even my younger brother.

My take is that FL, on the contrary, is the make-or-break crucial aspect of one's journey from being poor to being rich. A case in point, the idea of multiple income streams is part of FL.

Another dimension that is missing in OP's post is the various assistance that we get from a society that is more or less conscious of economic inequalities. It is literally impossible to ""lift one's boat"" on your own without help from fellow citizens. That is why we pay our taxes and duties. This is why electing political leaders is critical to our collective dream of ""lifting our boats"" together to not so much to become rich, but to narrow the gap between those who can afford a more comfortable life and those who cannot even gather enough material for a decent shelter or sufficient food to combat hunger.

Most big developers also owns big banks so laging financially backed ang projects and a bank which they own can also save it. 3. We have the strictest and also restrictive loaning policies 4. A lot of condos are used for money laundering (not even by pogos but locals or foreigners thats not from china) 5. Most luxury condos are paid in full in cash (think rockwell land in makati and most ALP projects in Manila)

Pinaka mahihirapan if wala ang POGO are office towers which really enjoyed the nice rental rates that are paid in advance.. and mga SMDC owners that have mortgages on the condos they bought thinking they will get pogo rental rates.

And they are after the sales and profit not about the insurance itself. 

I left the position being an agent there becuase it’s affecting my morals anymore. I can’t get profit from people that who work so hard and pay some of it to VUL that the agent has 45% cut from it. 

It’s like networking(MLM) in that branch. More travel benefits and overflowing cash incentives that is given to agents. They told me you’ll get rich by recruiting more agents than selling insurance. Coz you get commissions from agents that you recruit too.

✅Upto 100% of what you pay for your VULs in the first year goes to the sales force. 
(1) This is partly true. It depends on the plan that you get. Ung cheapest VUL, none of it gets allocated talaga sa investment on the first year. In training, they're taught to be transparent about this pero di ko sure what happens IRL. 
(2) Partly true lang kasi it doesn't go entirely sa sales force. It also pays for taxes and other fees. 


✅They get commission from your monthly payment for Upto 5yrs for certain types of plans. 
(1) This is also true! Pero bihira ung plans na up to 5 years may commission ng agent ang kung meron man, 5% na lang ng premium yon. 

✅In the event that you cancel your plan in the first few years, you won't be able to get the full amount of your fund value. 
(1) Partly true kasi this doesn't apply to all plans. Check your policy booklet tapos hanapin nyo ung ""surrender charge""
(2) If you're thinking of cancelling your plan, I'd suggest to stop paying until your policy lapses - at least insured ka pa rin for a little longer. But in this case, don't expect any fund value na. 

✅Many agents do not actually know what they are selling you. 
(1) In training, syempre tinuturo yan sa kanila. But from what I've heard, may ibang strategy ung mga branches. 
(2) Tbh, di masyadong bright ung ibang agents. 

✅Agents are trained to respond to your objections. 
(1) Of course lol. They undergo sales training so part talaga 'yon, I think in whatever sales role naman part talaga yan ng development plan nila. 
(2) Agree dun sa tip na just say no or you're uncomfortable or wag nyo na lang replyan if via chat. 

✅If you really need life insurance, get a term insurance which is very cheap, and invest the bulk of your money in other investment vehicles like Pag-ibig MP2, REITs, or PERA. All of these can be automated for convenience. This way, you'll be saving A LOT of money.
(1) If you're familiar with these insurance and investment options, I'd suggest to go for it! Hindi talaga para sa lahat ang VUL.

Ayon lang. If you have questions, lmk!!",10

lum0uj1,1gfy31y,t3_1gfy31y,"I actually work for 1 of the 2 companies you mentioned peddling trash ice cream and while I am thankful for my job I’m not a loyalist to my company. 

That being said ice cream landscape in the country is strange to say the least. Its part of the crazy world of FMCG and the pain points you mentioned are things our company faces as well. Ice cream just isnt a must buy commodity for our third world country. Its a treat, usually for celebrations. This is why ice cream tubs do so well here. People save their hard earned money to buy them and eat with family. 

In my opinion for your company to be a true disruptor is if you can price your product as one of the cheapest and still have superior quality. These big companies are investing more into creating “value for money” ice cream lines. Meaning lower quality but more affordable due to the rising costs of raw materials and other factors like inflation.

On the distribution side naman you need to decide whether you will plan on buying freezers to be rented by retailers OR just have them store it in freezers themselves. Both of which are very hard to do especially if alam mo ugali ng mga pinoy. (Naglalagay ng tocino and other products sa freezer kahit na bawal)


Tldr; ice cream is not a hot commodity and has a very intricate business model, It in itself is hard to penetrate without large capital and proper business model (freezer management and expansion plans)",54

It helps to have a trustworthy life partner, but if you dont have one dont rush it. Now my business is run by my wife and i plus a secretary, and guess what? we didnt really need to expand the business as of yet.

We run the business from the bottom up, always thinking of quality before quantity. A lesson learned and much aprreciated now. The secret recipe for our success is the quality, which from your post i think you have.

You have your niche, you know the numbers. All you need is a reset. And go back to the reason why you started in the 1st place- to give good quality and affordable healthy food (God knows we all need it). If your reason for starting doesn't rhyme with you anymore, then please surrender qith peace in your heart. But if your reason still kindles a spark, please do go on.

I think your only mistake was trying to gain so much too fast too soon. Slow down a bit and have patience. After 9 years I realized its what i just needed. The expansion will come all in due time. You'll know it, cos when it does come, it will fill you with excitement and not dread, contentment and not pleasure.

Good luck OP, padayun and Godspeed.",48

lundy2k,1gfy31y,t3_1gfy31y,"I also nerded out on ice cream during the pandemic. I had first made ice cream following my Philips ice cream makers recipes 14 years ago, but idk, during the lockdowns I felt inspired to make ice cream. I managed to get my hands on a lot of different emulsifiers, stabilizers, sugars. I tried lots of different creams and milks. I figured out fat/sugar/milk solids/ water ratios for different fruits, nuts, liquors, etc. I successfully made sorbet, gelato, frozen custard, sorbetes (the coconut milk and cassava starch style), American and french style ice cream. I got to make sugar free and dairy free ice cream as well. I got Brix testers, 2 batch freezers, a pasteurizer, and almost bought a blast freezer. It was damn good. The only thing I struggled with was swirls and inclusions. I personally delivered small batches of ice cream around the Greater Manila area for the few months I was selling.


Not a lot of people were not willing to pay a premium for an all-natural ice cream with natural stabilizers/emulsifiers, with very low overrun. People were even scared by the science. They hear scientific terms and processes and correlate it to being artificial or full of chemicals. I should have just kept my mouth shut about that part, tbh.

I also experimented with using chemicals, of course. Being able to keep ice cream ice free and scoop able right out of the freezer after 2 weeks, with just one tiny little extra ingredient was really scary.

I saw, from my experience in other businesses and from trying for a while, that it was not something that I could scale up while maintaining the same level of quality. Ultimately not because of the ingredients or costs, or labor or logistics. People! People suck. I could not scale up without someone trying to get the recipes or take away control for some important steps of the process. I was being asked to make compromises or switch to cheaper ingredients. 

 I make ice cream for friends and family, on small equipment, having sold almost all the big stuff. 

I hope to work with chefs one day to make really good ice cream for restaurants though. Something that doesn't have to be stored for long. I hope you don't lose your passion for ice cream! But I'll admit I lost mine and it's not really back yet. I don't even eat ice cream when I'm on vacation, and I used to purposefully visit ice cream shops for that purpose.",15

2. Vegetables, fresh meats and seafood prices are controlled either by the mayor/governor (of the source city/province) or a group of distributors. If they want to create a fake scarcity, they can.

Yes healthcare can get expensive but I dont think its enough to ruin someones entire savings unless youre working only minimum wage and only saving up for less than 5 years worth.

The story you quoted is from someone on Stage 4 cancer which is on the EXTREME end of the scale diseases. 
At that point, depending on the type of cancer, survival rate goes down to 1%. Treating very advanced cancer is hard and very expensive.(usually the attempt to cure is futile)

Here's a piece of advice. Staying Fit and having regular checkups and getting the occasional cancer screening for common ones like Breast or Prostate or Lung (especially for smokers and vapenation) will go a long way to saving you money.

Prevention is better than cure. It's also cheaper.
While you cant really prevent cancer if it's hereditary, you can catch it in an early screening. Treating early stage of any disease is far cheaper than an advanced one.

I dont need to be a doctor to tell you that avoiding smoking, drinking in moderation and excercising regularly like 3 to 4 times a week will do wonders to your health. Many common Diseases like Diabetes, Lung Cancer, Gastritis and Heart disease can all be easily prevented.

Tinuro lahat satin yan noong grade school at highschool.
Marami lng talaga pasaway or nde naniniwala, which they end up paying for in the long run

OFC if you have stuff like severe allergies or are physically disabled you should consult your doctor.
Just to be clear, I'm not discounting what happened to the stage 4 patient and her child. There are ethical reason why she chose to try and save her mother.
All I'm saying is, IF available naman na technology and sometimes free pa screening programs, best to have it done earlier.",34
m8xdh8c,1i86wap,t3_1i86wap,"Stage 4 cancer is TERMINAL.  No amount of money or healthcare in the world can save your friend’s mother. Months or few years na lang itatagal nyan. Acceptance na lang. If I’m ~60 yo with Stage 4 cancer, pipiliin ko na lang to live my life to the fullest, rather than to punish my body with aggressive radiation for the slimmest chance of survival.",9

m8qxk0o,1i86wap,t3_1i86wap,"First of all, healthcare is expensive everywhere.

Second, healthcare is a business. This includes insurances and hmos. They need to pay the cost of their investment for the property, machines, employees, professional fees of doctors, medicines, etc. All of those are not cheap.

m8tpvbz,1i86wap,t3_1i86wap,"True mahal talaga healtchcare sa atin. Lalo na sa time ng parents natin na wlaa pa masyadong CI at medical insurance forced talaga sila mag out of pocket.

Aside from this, isang issue din na nakikita ko sa pinoy is lack of prioritization sa health.

Sabi nga nila you can have 1000 problems today but when you face a health problem that's the only problem that matters.

People should be more intentional in what they eat, exercise and regular executive check ups. Very typical kasi sa atin ang ""hindi ako magpapa check up kasi baka may makitang sakit"". 
And kung may sakit na we often just want to treat symptoms rather than prevent the illness (lalo na if lifestyle illnesses) 

Maiiwasan ang gulatan if early palang you have data ka na sa health mo.

I'm not saying this is a perfect approach e.g. Cancer can sometimes just come out of the blue lalo na if rare form of cancer but at least we do our part early on. 

Ito talaga biggest fear ko sa parents namin ng wife ko yung critical illness that could wipe away all our savings. Di na kasi sila insurable. 

Share ko lang din yung mama ng wife ko had cancer pero very early stages, we approached a government hospital for the surgery with the help of our doctor friend, sugery was free but we had to pay s mga meds n di available sa hospital we shelled out around 30k. Scheduling was tough thoufh na pupushback kasi di urgent care yung surgery ni mama, from original sched of may naging june but it was fine. We understood na may mas life threatening na dapat maunsa or maisingit. 

Buti nlng early detection,  now may lifetime maintenance lng siya na oral meds for the cancer. Also upon last check wala n daw trace sa cancer. We hope that the cancer does not come back. 

We also had a talk sa wife ko, should i have a terminal illness, i wouldn't want to sacrifice my quality of life by spending the last few months in a hospital bed and jeopardizing her future in the process.",3
m8trp30,1i86wap,t3_1i86wap,"Agree with the comments here. Last resort mo na siguro magbenta ng properties pag usapang hospital bills. Exhaust all possible options. Magfile ka ng indigency kung kailangan.


Also, kahit anong ipon talaga, kung walang insurance, mauubos. Because your money is used at face value. Unlike insurance na binayaran mo ng 100k for 1Million coverage, you multiply your money's worth. 


But a lot of us think, hindi naman kailangan magpainsure kung wala namang nararamdaman. ",3

 Also if you have money, and cancer or difficult to treat ang illness, go to Singapore for treatment na lang. Hindi nagkakalayo ang presyo sa premier hospitals sa Pinas and mas maganda ( or modern for lack of correct wordings) ang treatment protocols.

Nakakairita pa ang mga critical illness riders sa mga insurances, super pahirapan kunin ang benefits.

m8u4xbp,1i86wap,t3_1i86wap,"I worked in health financing, and once had a task of reviewing different SOAs from different hospitals sa Pinas. Ang laki talaga ng difference ng charges ng high-end hospitals from others. Not even talking about the facilities or professional fees kasi reasonable naman yun. Consumables or lab tests palang ang mahal na, imagine same na gamot (same brand, same dosage) or same na medical consumable (e.g. gauze or cannula) can be priced 50-100% more of cost charged by public or smaller name private hospital. These consumables or tests add up, lalo kung confined ng matagal at maraming procedure.

 Agree sa other comments that marami namang public facilities na okay (remember, more patients, mas praktisado mga doctor) and cost effective. UP PGH and DOH tertiary hospitals, but also pwede rin may doctor kang gusto pero sa iba magpa confine or sa iba magpa-lab test.

Kaya for me shop around sa hospitals, ask for second opinions, and equip yourself with information. Talk to doctor friends if you have them and ask ano yung mga necessary lang gawin at anong mga long term scenarios. Sometimes palliative or end of life care should also be considered, so you can have your family comfortable at home while spending time with them w/o the business and cold hospital rooms. May pagkamahal din yun pero at least di ka na aasa and magbabayad sa tests or inpatient care na mahal.

While we want to give our families the best care for their illness, expensive health care is not always the best care.",2

About migrating to Canada: My advice is to go back to college / university as soon as you have enough savings and have a degree that's in demand in Canada. That will help you when you decide to apply for Canada PR. It doesn't really matter which school you choose as the goal is to have a degree. Then strive to be the best at what you do.

So that's 13% yield of 384k. But that's hypothetical for now since on the second year, you're saving while investing? I don't know what percentage goes to saving, and to investing.

**Third year until mid-year:** Kakahanap mo palang ng caretaker, so the setup and other things to do I'd assume at least a month. Let's assume na binenta mo yung share from dividend na 50k, ang puhunan sa livestock for pig is 8k per head until maibenta. Ang cow naman around 30-40 per head ang pang alaga. So I don't know how a 50k would suffice unless you stopped investing in stocks at this point. Mejo magulo sa part na to since maghahati pa kayo sa kita ng caretaker, then less 10% sa hati mo pa. Let's say 10 heads nalang, ang puhunan jan ay \~8k per head. Live weight is 180pesos per kilo, and 80kgs yung baboy. So ang net is \~6.5k times 10 heads = 65k, divide by 2 (caretaker) = 37.7k, less 10% = **\~34k (net for 10 heads)**.

Ang baka naman, matagal ang harvest so wala ka pa kita dito.

**Fourth year:** Unless nagdagdag ka ng head ng baboy, let say 20 heads. You only have 68k net \* 2 harvest per year = 136k. Assuming walang namatay sa pigs at assuming nagdagdag ka ng pig heads. And assuming din na walang ASF during that time.

136k (livestock) + 50k (dividend) = less than 200k. And the 136k isn't a passive income here.

&#x200B;

So I don't know how did you come up with 400k *passive* income after 4 years.

Sorry, I'm not buying this, OP. Good if you did.",567

kq2xpgv,1aoxz61,t3_1aoxz61,"400k PHP? 

I'm USA. I bring in about 800-900k PHP annually for USA dividends. But I have roughly 24M PHP invested.

You're saying you have about 12M PHP invested or just focused on dividend and perhaps no growth. 

Any growth on those holdings or strictly dividend payers.",18
kq56ijd,1aoxz61,t3_1aoxz61,"Well first of all other than stocks or financial investment there are no other passive income. Baboy isn't passive, and there's a large social cost and risk to it as well. I know cuz my relative was a pig farmer so I know this stuff second hand. 


Secondly I'm not buying your story. With only an income of 40k that would be like 36k after taxes. 80% of your net income after taxes so you only spent 7k a month? So what you live with your parents rent free who pay for your food, utilities and necessities? Even if all your meals are canned goods and siomai from Ministop sorry 7k ain't enough to live in PH.

I mean if we can all live off our parents then we already have passive income. It's then very easy to take all that money and put it somewhere where it will gain money.",19

2. Look into the IDRP - interbank debt relief program. https://www.ccap.net.ph/credit-card-basics/payments-and-collections/
3. What is the impact of having unpaid bank loans? First, walang nakukulong sa unpaid loans, so don’t worry about that. What will happen is it will fuck up their credit scores, which will greatly affect their ability to make certain financial transactions with banks in the future (like, they will not get approved for loans). Which is actually not a bad consequence, because this hopefully should prevent them from getting into more cc debt in the future.
4. Prioritize your sister’s education over the bank loans, if you want to help them out. The banks can write off loans (and they have allotted budget for bad debts) but your sister’s education isn’t something you guys should just throw away cause your parents made some bad decisions.
5. Do NOT take out a loan to try to pay for their loan. You will ruin your credit score on top of theirs. It’s not a smart decision. You need to keep your credit okay so that you have more options in the future in case of certain emergencies (like what if one of your parents has a health emergency and you’re short and di ka Maka-loan for their hospital bills because you destroyed your credit trying to help them pay their cc debt?).

li42xak,1erzfpd,t3_1erzfpd,"First of all, I want to acknowledge the heavy burden you’re carrying as a young breadwinner, especially in such a challenging financial situation. It’s not easy, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. Here’s a strategy that might help:

1. Avalanche Method

•Your plan to use the avalanche method is a sound one. It focuses on paying off debts with the highest interest rates first, which saves you money on interest over time. Since you’re pre-qualified for a bank loan with a 1.5% interest rate, consider using it to pay off one of the higher-interest debts, like the active credit cards. This could significantly reduce the interest you’re paying.

2. Consolidation

•If you can find a way to consolidate the credit card debts (for example, by transferring balances to a card with a lower interest rate or taking out a lower-interest personal loan), this could simplify your payments and reduce interest. However, be careful to check for any fees or penalties associated with transferring balances.

3. Emergency Fund

•You’ve already built up a ₱150k emergency fund, which is excellent. I would recommend keeping this intact for true emergencies. In your situation, you don’t want to deplete your safety net.

4. Cutting Expenses and Increasing Income

•Look at your current expenses to see if there are any areas where you can cut back, even temporarily. This will free up more money to put toward debt repayment.
•Consider if there are ways to increase your income, even if it’s through part-time work, side gigs, or using your skills in the healthcare field for freelance opportunities.

5. Negotiate with Creditors

•Sometimes creditors are willing to negotiate lower interest rates or extended payment terms, especially if they know you’re struggling. It’s worth calling and explaining your situation to see if they can offer any relief.

6. Involve Your Parents

•Your parents should be involved in this process, even if they have limited income. They need to understand the gravity of the situation and contribute where they can, even if it’s a small amount. Additionally, this might be a good time for them to learn more about managing finances to avoid repeating these mistakes.

7. Mental Health

•The stress of being a breadwinner and handling significant debt can take a toll on your mental health. Don’t hesitate to reach out for support from friends, family, or even professional counseling. Sometimes just talking through your situation can help relieve some of the burden.

8. Education for Sibling

•As the eldest, you might feel the pressure to support your sibling’s education. If possible, explore scholarships, grants, or financial aid that your sibling can apply for to help lessen the financial load on you.

9. Long-term Plan

•It’s important to create a long-term financial plan once the debts are under control. This should include building up savings, starting investments, and securing insurance. It may feel distant now, but having a plan can give you hope for the future.

This is a tough spot to be in, but taking it one step at a time can make it more manageable. Focus on small victories and take care of your well-being throughout this process. You’re already doing an incredible job under immense pressure.",3

kcf5rj0,18d4f2b,t3_18d4f2b,"I was not an only child but due to circumstances, I was the one who fixed the papers. It really hit me that I am adult at that point and was questioning why I'm the one doing this when I'm the bunso.

It's important to tackle them one by one. You have 1 year to file for Estate Tax, do the other ""easy stuff"" first.

PART 1
1. Publish the death in a newspaper's obituary section. The half newspaper, almost tabloid layout will be cheaper.
2. List down all properties - real properties (lots, H&L, commercial building) and personal properties (car, bank account, stocks, etc). Decide what you want to do with them, keep yourself or sell. This will be later on written on the affidavit.
3. If you know that atm pin or mobile banking passwords, withdraw or transfer that money to your account. Notify the bank regarding the death only after you've emptid the account. Else, this will be freezed and subject to Estate Tax.
4. If you don't know the pin or password, you can actually get the money and just ask for the bank for the form that allows them to deduct the tax from whatever you'll withdraw. There are other requirements as well which I cant recall now.
5. If your parents have insurances, get them next. This is the easiest to claim, usually just need to fill up a form and give cooy of Death Cert. With SunLife, 1 week processing only.
6. Good news if you got the bank and insurance money, you may have enough to pay for the expenses

PART 2 (remember you have 1 year to file, no need to rush)
7. Get a lawyer. Present the list of properties you made and make sure to bring all titles so that they can type up exact land description. Important: Tell the lawyer to make Affidavit for EACH property. I made the mistake of making just 1 deed for all properties so I had to wait till the other released the stamped deed to process another property.

All properties you decide to keep = Affidavit of Self Adjudication / Properties you decide to sell = Affidavit of Self Adjusication with Absolute Sale

If you did Step 2, you don't need to include it in the list of properties.

8. Have affidavit notarized and published in a newspaper. Make sure to keep the newspaper and have multiple copies if you have a lot of properties.
9. Get list of requirements to for estate tax filing and go to BIR to settle Estate Tax. Keep all receipts and the Certificate of Payment of Estate Tax.

PART 3 (this doesn't need to be done in a year, only part 2 is part of the 1 year deadline)
10. For the properties you decide to keep, you have to go to each city/province's Real Property department and fulfill requirements for transfer to your name.
11. Wait for release of the new titles under your name.
12. For properties you decide to sell, you don't need to transfer proprty to your name. That's what the Ansolute Sale part is for. If property was paid in cash, give the buyer the title and certified true copy of the Certificate of Payment of Estate Tax, keep the original. Let them manage the name transfer. If not paid in cash, only facilitate the name transfer after payment.
13. With the car, process is same with real properties basically but with LTO.

I hope this helps!! Some might not be as straightforward depending on the properties tou're dealing with but I'm sure you'll figure it out.

It's really very overwhelming but take it one step at a time and give yourself time to grieve.",874

If no will, then all of their estates (real and properties) are automatically inherited by you as their only heir. But I think you’ll still need to process transfering the titles to your name. You might want to consult a lawyer.

kcepy9v,18d4f2b,t3_18d4f2b,[deleted],48
kcfyfq9,18d4f2b,t3_18d4f2b,"1. You have to make this one first. Deed of Sole Adjudication. Either you make one or get a lawyer to do it. It should include all the real properties. Also include shares of stocks and vehicles if any unless you plan to not have it transferred to your name or sell them in the future. Bank accounts too, but if you have access to these through mobile apps/ATM cards, you should empty it yourself and not mention it anymore.
2. Then have it notarized. The moment you do this, the 60 day deadline for paying LGU transfer taxes starts. If you're near the deadline already, you can go straight to step 5 and ask if they can compute it for you so you don't have to pay penalties. Edit: Some LGUs will use the date of death as the start of the 60 day deadline.
3. Have the deed publicized. I used BULGAR newpaper. You can go straight to next step before this is complete.
4. Pay the estate tax with BIR RDO where her registered address is. Do this within 1 year of death date. You'll need copies of all the property titles and tax declarations, stock certificates and vehicle registration and insurance papers (if any). Bring copy of their last credit card bill and other bills or receipts related to their death, you can use these as deductible. Also a barangay certificate stating their main address (if property is owned) since it is also deductible.
5. Go to LGU city/municipal hall of each property and have the transfer tax computed and paid.
6. Go to Registry of Deeds of each property and have the title transferred to you.
7. Go back to LGU city/municipal hall assessor's office and transfer the tax declarations to your name after you get the new titles.

😅

First things first- I'm so sorry for this loss. No matter who you are losing your parents is one of the worst and toughest experiences one can go through in this life. 

Second- if you must go through this, at least you'd want to inherit things to help construct your life. I'd find one trustworthy attorney (usually a family friend can recommend one) to help evaluate and consolidate all of the assets you've inherited. Get a single list which is exhaustive of everything you now own, and how much it is all worth. 

Third- sell of what you don't need, or whatever can't be used to generate revenue. If it isn't an asset, it's a liability, and you want to have as few of those as possible.

Fourth- pace yourself. This is a lot to deal with, and the fallout of losing your loved ones and trying to sort out what they owned will take time to process. Likely years. It's important to embrace that fact, and accept that consolidation and selling are time-consuming, and a process- but one that is yours now. 

Sometimes we find ourselves in places like these. Sometimes by choice, but sometimes the situation is thrust upon us. Best you can, make the most of your situation. I've find helping others in the same situation can be one of the best, authentic ways to deal with your own. In time, hopefully you can build your circle (and perhaps even family) anew.",2

gratku7,m6ysrq,t3_m6ysrq,"Omg!!! I have the same sentiments at ganitong ganito napag-usapan namin ng asawa ko kahapon while discussing about our retirement.

I have things to add sa mga sinulat mo based na din sa experience ko dito sa Canada:

1. Low and unequal wage distribution. Nasa around 15-16K din ang salary ko when I started working as an accountant after I graduated. Then lumipat ako sa audit firm kahit mas bumaba sweldo ko kasi gusto kong i-practice pagka-CPA ko and sabi nila dati kapag galing ka ng audit firm madaling humingi ng malaking salary kapag lumipat ka sa ibang company. After 3 years nag-try ako maghanap ng bagong work kasi namumulubi na talaga ako sa work ko. Nagpasa ako sa apat na companies. Well, guess what? Ang layo sa expected salary ko ng offer nung tatlo at mga known na BPO companies ito ha. Luckily,  yung isa inofferan ako ng super lapit na sa asking price ko plus sobrang daming benefits at may profit share pa! Ang haba na pero ang point ko lang is akala ko dati kapag CPA ako malaki sweldo ko :( May mga clients din ako dati na akala nila malaki sweldo ko pero I think baka mas mababa pa nga kesa sa sweldo nila. One time nakita namin sweldo ng isa sa mga Directors namin sa audit firm (kasi naiwan nya sa printer yung application form sa lilipatan nya) na 10+ years na dun at nagulat kami kasi ang baba sa ineexpect namin :( Then lumipat siya sa isang multinational company pero ang baba lang din ng dagdag sa sweldo nya. For sure malaki asking nun kaya I think binarat siya at napilitan na lang din siguro siyang i-accept yung offer kasi sobrang dami talagang work sa audit firm at kapag inabutan ka pa ng start ng busy season ang hirap umalis.

Dito sa Canada mula nung nag-start ako mag-work malaki na din tinaas ng sweldo ko. Pero may itataas pa siguro yun kung hindi ako nag-mat leave twice. One year kasi ang mat leave dito so parang 2 years din akong hindi nag-work lol.

2. High taxes. Sobrang laki ng taxes dito sa Canada! Haha. Pero madami ka namang pwedeng ma-deduct - yung sa daycare ng anak mo, medical expenses na hindi covered ng province nyo, tuition fees at pati nga contribution mo sa simbahan at madami pa. So far mula nung nag-migrate kami, palagi naman kaming may tax refund. Ang masasabi ko lang sa Pilipinas ay ang laki laki ng tax pero hindi mo ramdam! 

3. Inadequate social benefits. Eto yung pinaka-nakakafrustrate sa Pilipinas. Yung madami ka ngang ipon pero pwedeng maubos kapag nagkasakit ka ng malala kasi minsan hindi pa nga kayang bayaran ng Philhealth at private insurance mo. Instead na yung sakit mo lang ang isipin mo, dadgag pa sa iisipin mo magkano babayaran mo sa ospital. Hindi ko alam how much maternity benefit ngayon sa SSS pero ang mat leave dito ay pwede kang pumili between 12 or 18 months. The gov't will pay you a maximum of $595/week kung pinili mo yung 12 months or $357/week kung 18 months. Pwedeng way below to ng current salary mo pero most employers will top it up ng ilang months para 100% pa din ng salary mo nakukuha mo. And pagbalik mo may work ka pa din.

4. Outrageously high property prices. 3.5 years ago nakabili kami ng bahay dito sa Canada na sa tingin namin hindi namin magagawa sa Pilipinas. Or makabili man kami baka sobrang layo na sa workplace namin. We have a 2 story house na may malaking backyard pero mas mahal pa yang 25M studio/1 BR na condo sa BGC na sinasabi mo lol. Pero to give context, sa prairies kami nakatira at hindi sa malalaking city so for sure mahal din properties kung let's say sa Toronto ka mismo nakatira. Pero so far yung mga friends namin from different provinces na may family din nakapag-pundar naman din sila ng bahay.

5. Inefficient and unresponsive government: No brainer to pero ang nakakainis lang may mga friends pa din ako na sobrang fan ni Duterte. Alam mong fanatic sila kasi wala kahit isang bagay na ginawa niya ang ni-call out nila. Like really? Perfect yung Presidente? LOL. At saka ang ayaw ko sa Pilipinas eh yung maglalakad ka ng mga documents like NBI clearance at passport kasi ang haba ng pila palagi pero baka mas okay na siya ngayon. 

6. Toxic work culture: Sobrang tama ka dito. We take things personally. Sa work ko ngayon I can disagree with my boss at honestly tell him how I feel about work. Sa mga meetings akala mo may away na nangyayari kasi hindi mag-agree minsan sa isang bagay pero nari-resolve din siya and walang samaan ng loob after. Dito din ako natutong mag-No at hindi mag-overpromise. Sa Pilipinas kasi dati kapag tinanong ng boss ko kung kaya kong tapusin ng Friday sasabihin ko Oo pero ang totoo kailangan kong mag-overtime (without pay) para matapos siya kasi I feel na kapag sinabi kong hindi, he'll take it against me or bibigyan nya ko ng mababang performance rating. 

7. Gatekeeping based on educational background. I can't say much about this kasi I graduated from one of the top 4 universities. Siguro nga isa ako sa mga na-prioritize over the other candidates when I was applying before. Pero after naman ng first job mo hindi na nagma-matter kung san ka galing na school. Madami akong kakilala na hindi galing sa top universities pero ang layo na ng narating nila ngayon. Yung asawa ko hindi din galing sa isang top university pero mas magaling siya sakin 😂 

At isa pang ayaw ko sa Pilipinas is yung age discrimination sa work. Nung nag-land ako sa Canada nagulat ako kasi matatanda yung mga agents. Yung sa work ko madami ding ka-age na ng nanay at tatay ko. 

I'll stop here kasi ang haba na pala ng comment ko 😂",37
gr8gxy3,m6ysrq,t3_m6ysrq,"I have the same sentiments.  I have seen ordinary employees/rank-and-file people getting abused by businesses just because they can.

Thus, they are able to pay them at minimum wage. Akalain mo yung bagong empleyado ang sahod 537/day (no problem here) pero yung empleyadong 30+ years na ang serbisyo sa negosyo nila, 612/day lang. Ikumpara natin yan sa ibang kompanya na umaabot nang 2,500/day sa tenured nilang  operator.

first thing I realized while working. haha. maximum benefit for SSS is 17k considering if you belong to those high paying contributor. We have Universal Healthcare tho, sana ma implement ng maayos. emphasis on ""SANA"". I pay half a million in annual tax plus the VAT sales I pay kaya sana ma implement to ng maayos ffs.

I already know that the entry-level compensation for these firms were awfully low (18k-20k) per month but if you came from a non-priority school you'll really get the low-end of the bargain. I worked there for almost 2 years and the cost of living in Makati just killed me. I had to live in one of those ""capsule rooms"" where you only get like a room the size of 2 coffins stacked on top of one another because I literally cannot spend any more on a decent-sized room and still manage to sustain my other necessities and give back to my family in the province. Not only that, but there were cockroaches constantly entering the capsule because some tenants just don't understand the concept of cleanliness I suppose. I can't even sit properly inside of my ""capsule"". I spent one year there and I know this may sound weird but the pandemic may have been an unexpected eye-opener for me since I got to get out of my old living conditions and stay at my parent's house back at the province through our work-from-home arrangement.

This generation is having a hard time owning their first home because majority don't have enough incomes to secure home loans. Maswerte sa mga iba na earning let's say more than PhP50K a month but that's only a minority. Most are still in the rental spiral. Isama mo pa na hindi lahat marunong magsave at mag-invest.   


I am putting off buying my first property purchase cause I want to save up more equity for it. For someone hustling everyday here in PH, I believe the real estate is in a bubble and the developers have their eyes on the expats/OFWs rather than the middle class. That alone is quite appalling. I saw it myself how Chinese migrants cause real estate prices soar in first world countries and I hope we don't have a POGO fueled rise again. Kawawa ang ordinaryong Pinoy.

I know as a licensed broker it’s difficult to sell a condo that is mortgaged unless you have cash buyers. You cannot sell it easily to someone who wants to loan on the property.

I dont consider condo as a good investment because of the high prices and uncertain market (at ayun na nga nagpandemic). I will only buy it for my own use but that will likely be a long time coming..... or siguro if i marry someone who’s in MM, it will easier for both of us to share the financial burden.

I would love to buy land though but unless you have significant savings, expensive na rin esp near or around MM. I bought nalang a property here in my province because prices are still affordable. I paid the full price with an amount that will probably only be the downpayment for a condo in MM lol.

A what-could-have-been scenario for you OP, as a board placer on nursing licensure exams, is if you continue with your profession in private hospitals in Manila, instead of the corporate path.  

Two of my highschool friends are now enjoying the fruit of their hardships in Western countries.

To make the long story short, now, one is in the US while the other one is in UK.  Hindsight is wala pang COVID at the time that they went there, but now they are exposed to the virus being a frontliner, Nonetheless, they're already vaccinated so chances of complications from the disease may be minimal.

Next is to **reach out to the banks** and tell them you're financially challenged. Come with them clean and extend a number you can go by in the next months. If it means prolonging the loan to 5 more years with a higher interest and lower monthly, do so. Yes, **ask for a loan restructuring**.

Lastly, **increase your income.** BTW, increase your income and not your lifestyle expenses. Do remember, health is wealth. This means you can be over-employed but find a balance.

The past is the past so focus on your profile and skills.

Mahirap tlga yan both mental at physical and marami tlagang gastos, milyon milyon. I've been on the same boat as you, ako lang breadwinner sa family of 5 adults. 2 elders and 1 with disability.

  
Ito mga solution ko for you.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. Makiusap ka s mga banks for loan reconstruction. Try mo ipa extend terms to lower monthly payments. As much as gusto ko ma-debt free ka agad, hindi mo kakayanin for now. So ito muna unahin mo kung d mo kaya mapataas immediately ung income stream mo.

2. Side Gigs for you and husband - I used to work 16hrs a day just to pay off all debts. I know, hindi to kaya ng body and marami pang health issues pag prolonged. Pero why not dalawa kau ni husband na magwork for a single job? Find a work na pwedeng tig 4hrs kau ni husband. Ginawa ko na din to with a friend nun kasi dalawa kaming baon s utang. Ang pros nga dito e yung productivity hati din saming dalawa kya ang gaganda ng output and mas mabilis ang raise.

3. Ask for financial help for your parent na may cancer from government programs/congressman/etc - nagbibigay sila lalo pag malapit eleksyon.

  
NEXT STEPS:

Since 5 yrs kana sa VA job, baka pwede mo naman gawin ung same output with less time? I used to do a single VA job for 12hrs a day (tech job na mahirap) for 20K a month. 6 years later 2hrs a day ko nlng ginagwa ung job, 50K salary (boss gave me yearly increase). When I started to have more time for myself, nag upskill ako s marketing. Ngaun I have multiple digital marketing clients, multiple side income sources (websites, stocks and dividends) and a thriving construction business (On my way to establishing the business to a corporation.)

- stock market (recommend ko ung copy trade ng Etoro kasi dun ako kumita ng malaki pra ipang invest s construction business. Dunno kung may other advice regarding better ways than i did)

- own business - since VA ka din like ako, our jobs are not always stable. high income but not stable. Kelangan mo tlga ng side business.

Compute tayo konti. Sabihin na nating 2.5% lang ang interest ng utang kada buwan. Interest pa lang nasa 42.5k pesos na. Wala pang principal yan. Tapos 80k lang ang income ninyong 2. Sa 80k... kunwari 50k ang napupunta pambayad sa utang.  42k sa interest. 8k sa principal.. after approx. 18yrs or more makakalaya ka na sa utang kung walang papalya or magcelebrate ng bday or kakain sa labas. Goodbye to a better life for the family for 2 decades. Kaso hindi yan 2.5% lang per month di ba? Gawin nating 10k pambayad sa principal... 15yrs to pay.

I get that you paid for medical bills. Pero mukhang yung thought process ninyo ended at getting money for the bills. Hindi ninyo naisip life will go on after the bills.. at this pt.. anong klaseng buhay na meron ang family after making that decision. 

Di pa bottom of the ocean yang situation ninyo. Antayin mo magkatotoo yung ipapalit mo health mo... see what happens to you and the family once isa sa inyo magkasakit. That is going to be a new level of low. Kung basic food at walang budget sa healthcare paano na.. imposibleng di kayo bibisita ng ospital sa loob ng 2 dekada. 

You made the wrong decision. Now to correct it, suggestions ko. Do them all.

1. Ask for donations from other people pambayad ng principal. Pumila sa PCSO, local charity, sumali sa game shows sa tv na namimigay ng pera to entertain their viewers, etc. 

2. Take out a loan sa sss and pagibig. Use that to pay part of your debt. Mas mababa interest nila.  Pero maliit lang din maloan mo. Better than nothing. Try to find if merong magrefinance ng utang ninyo at a lower rate. Keep checking this regularly kahit partial. Same concept why u will take a loan sa sss Nd Pagibig. 

3. Humanap kayo parehas ng mas stable na job. 50k sa VA after paying dues philhealth.. sss etc..  siguro nasa 30k+ lang din net. Ngayon mo mas kailangan ng philhealth at sss dahil wala ka pambayad ng ibang insurance. Si hubby 30k is just plain small. Pero at least sana may hmo sya kahit maliit coverage.

Once your Security Bank credit line is re established, take a personal loan so you can pay all the other loans.

Real life experience. 

Yung brother ko pinakasalan niya gf niya without us knowing it as advised ng father-in-law niya kasi ""civil"" lang naman daw. 
Yung napangasawa ng brother ko is professional pero chose not to work at stay at home because of her reason na ""21 palang siya alam na niya na ang pangarap niya sa buhay niya ay maging housewife"". 
Note, we are not financially dependent to our parents and vice versa. And most of all my entire family is not financially dependent to my brother despite of his wealth. 
Sad to say, after years, my brother visited us and cried and asked forgiveness from my Mom (ang dami kasing nangyari to the point na never kaming kinausap ng brother ko for years. Dahil sa upbringing namin, hinayaan nalang namin siya. Too much pain na kasi and kabastusan yung ginawa ng asawa niya sa parents ko at sa aming magkakapatid).
Then, sinabi niya lahat samin. Na ayaw ng wife niyang kausapin kami or lapitan from the very start. Na pinilit lang siyang magpakasal ng tatay ng asawa niya. Nagising nalang siya one day na pagod na and fed up na kasi narealize niya na binubuhay niya buong angkan nung napangasawa niya. At too much na yung babae. Take note, wala pang anak yung Kuya ko dahil may sakit yung babae. 
Tapos doon niya nasabi multiple times, ""kung sana nagwork siya eh di nagtutulungan kami ngayon at wala siyang time mag-isip ng mga walang kwentang bagay"".

Ayun, kaya best example yan sakin. Na malaking factor ang vision ng mapapangasawa mo sa life niya at life ng family niya. Kasi tandaan natin, di lang naman PURE LOVE ang need natin to survive, there are more factors. Just saying...",351
ku0qi45,1ba4g55,t3_1ba4g55,"Super duper agree with this. Like saming mag asawa, we chose each other kasi alam naming same kami ng beliefs pagdating sa pera, though hindi lahat like generous ako masyado at sya ang nagccheck and balance sa akin kasi kaya ako naabuso haha. Sa kanya naman sobrang kuripot ako naman nagtuturo na minsan maging generous. 


Other than that same kami ng hindi basta basta nagpapautang, hindi din basta basta nagbibigay sa relatives, same kami na marunong magbudget, same kami na may delayed gratification, same kami na hindi maluho, mas mahalaga ang needs kesa wants, kung may wants pagiipunan at hindi impulsive buying. Kaya sa sobrang delaying gratification naming mag asawa iisipin ko na bilhin na yung gusto nya kapag may extra, sya din nagiipon ng sarili para daw mabili din yung gusto ko haha. Oh diba galing!😂 


Sobrang tuwang tuwa kaming dalawa and proud kami na asawa namin isa't isa kapag may mga great decisions kaming nagagawa para sa pamilya and when it comes to finances. 


Lagi din naming kinoconsult isa't isa kapag may malaking purchase or may tutulungan, laging sinasabi namin sa iba na ""pagusapan muna naming magasawa"", we don't do decisions ng kami lang lalo na kung maapektuhan ang finances namin. Same kami mahilig sa negosyo, sinusupport ako ng hubby ko sa mga ideas ko kasi sya nag capital ako nagiisip ng gagawin. Sya din magaling sa mga documents ako naman sa numbers. 


Mga hindi namin afford noon ngayon afford na namin, sabi namin we're in this together, galing kami sa baba at sabay kaming umaakyat at maabot mga pangarap namin. Sobrang perfect naming 2, kumbaga we're each other's missing pieces. We complete each other. Two is better than one samin. 🥰 


Kaya sa mga pipili ng makakasama habang buhay kilalanin nyo na agad mag jowa palang kayo huwag kayong maging bulag sa red flag, we're not perfect madami din kaming flaws pero yung flaws na kaya naming tanggapin and itolerate pero hindi naman nakakasira ng relasyon at pagkatao and we still work it out gumagawa ng paraan para magbago for the better. Yung handang mag compromise, yung priority namin ang isa't isa at ang pamilya.


I remember kasi nung nagpropose na sya sakin nilatag ko talaga lahat sa kanya ng beliefs ko and no.1 na sinabi ko din is ayokong pgaawayan namin ang pera, kung tingin nya hindi ako compatible sa beliefs nya when it comes to finances sabihin na nya agad para matignan ano pwedeng ma compromise ko, same din sa kanya sinabi ko mga bagay na napapansin ko, sabi ko din ayokong magtataguan kami ng pera na nagbigay pala kami sa iba hindi namin sinabi etc etc. Ayun kaya alam namin agad kung bagay ba kami para mamuhay ng habany buhay haha.",80

if partner cannot adapt well to society and cannot survive a competitive market, there is a big chance you will end up as the family sole provider.  if they have history of cancer or other genetically inheritable disease, it can happen on your partner and future child and a potential financial burder (also illness of family in-law can be your problem too). 

for us, we probably lived in a culture of simply accepting things like ""ok lang, mahal na mahal ko e"" and just let it be one of the things where we let our emotions be the bigger factor in our decisions.

We've been in LDR our entire relationship and when I asked him last Wednesday when we can meet he says he still has to pay debts (he's paying the load of his mom). Gave him many advice on how he can save up what can be left of his money but still no improvement is happening. 

He suggested we break up and said mean things that ""I"" look down on him daw, na hindi niya daw maabot expectations ko. Nagpintig na tenga ko kaya nag agree nako, to think na he's been working for 4 yrs (25 yrs old) and ako 5 months (23 yrs old fresh grad) and he can say such mean things when all I wanted was for both of us to be financially stable and not experience our poverty life during both of our childhood.

Just say no. Why would you blame your partner for how others behave and how you respond to them? Different story if yung partner mo mismo yung financially problematic. I dont really know ha, why'd you even marry the person if you only think about how they affect your finances?",7

Nung nagkakilala kami ng asawa ko, we are both broke sa totoo lang. Parehas tumutulong sa pamilya. Ni hindi makapagdate kung kelan gusto, minsan matagal kami hindi magkikita kasi wala kaming budget dahil mas priority ang kanya kanyang family namin. We decided to take sidelines para may pera kaming pangsarili. Delay ang sahod sa sidelines so tuwing sasahod lang nakakalabas. 

Eventually, yung mga kapatid namin is nakatulong na rin sa pamilya tapos nakalipat na rin sa mas good paying na trabaho. Umalwan alwan na kami. Nung mag-asawa na kami, ang agreement is dapat transparent sa lahat ng bagay lalo sa finances. Ang maganda naman sa amin mag-asawa is compatible talaga kami sa financial aspect at maganda ang communication namin. Nakabudget din ng maayos yung funds namin. Kung need tumulong sa pamilya, pinag-uusapan ng maayos para walang samaan ng loob. Sa investments, dapat naiinitindihan ng bawat isa yung risk at dapat agree parehas para walang sisihan. 

I agree na isa ring financial decision ang pag-aasawa. Need mo pumili ng taong compatible sayo, same mindset, open makipagcommunicate para hindi magkaproblema sa finances in the future.",7

Kung matured naman parehas kayo, common sense nalang mga yan. Wla rin ako plano na payagan partner ko to freely spend my funds pag kasal na. I don't plan in marrying a 'housewife'. My mom was one and she became totally crazy staying in the house all those years doing the same thing over and over again.

Tito 2: Married a woman from low income household. Masinop, di maluho. Married also for 30+ years. Nasa exclusive subdivision sila nakatira malapit sa Nuvali. Hanggang ngayon di pa rin sila maluho. Ang weekends nila ay spent tending to their flowers at going to church, or pupunta sa Silang para bumili ng halaman. Tito 2 is also currently a manager.

Maganda to sa mga sellers like naghahabol sila ng inventory for upcoming campaign, meron sila pang replenish ng stocks nila right away. Kung sa bank kasi na super tagal ng approval, wala na di na aabutan yung pambayad ng supplier nila. Lahat naman ng negosyo need ng urgent loan sometimes. Konting kita is still kita. Yan yung sinasabi nila na pwede ka magpalaki ng negosyo mo ng kahit walang capital na ganun kalaki. Spaylater is for buyers naman nung nagcompute ako 3.67%/mo including dst, okay naman to kasi may exclusive vouchers for spaylater payment. When you deduct the free sf or cashback vouchers exclusive for spaylater payment plus yung discount for flash sales, almost none nalang din ang interest which is comparable na sa may cc na walang interest for a month. When I compared to gcash/gloan/ggives ang kapareho niya si spaylater. SLoan medyo ok pa kasi malaki credit limit tapos wala collateral. Pang urgent business need lang talaga siya na need ng big spending. Nasa tao lang yan kung gagawin na opportunity yung ganto or ilulubog mo sarili sa utang. Hindi lahat kaya magprovide ng loan docs sa bank, and I think good thing na may ganto. Hindi din lahat may creditcard na madami offers na mababang interest. Remember, halos mga tao sa shopee mga small sellers yan. Mga tao nga sa palengke they resort to 5/6 bombay that’s 20% monthly pero kumikita pa din sila. For end-consumer, I’d rather go for lazpaylater ng lazada, 0% for 1month sila rather than using spaylater ni shopee. Yun lungs 😊",5

Galing sa taniman ng bigas at copra. Namatay siya 95 yrs old, at bilang only child, wala siyang kahati sa mga namanang ari-arian.

Habang nabubuhay pa siya, simple lang mga daily activities. Mostly magisa lang sha sa bahay kase namatay Lolo ko ng maaga. Everyday sha nag-ga-gamas (nagta-tanggal ng damo) sa paligid ng bahay. Gigising siya bago mag-6 AM, magpapainit ng tiyan Sustagen o Milo kase hindi siya nagkakape, tapos diretso na sa bundok sa likod ng bahay. Sa tanghali, uuwi siya para kumain at magpahinga, tapos sa hapon, marami pa shang ibang inaasikaso. Nagbibilad sha ng cacao, nagtatanggal ng buto ng kapok para gawing unan, nagta-tahip ng palay, namumulot ng bato na galing sa ilog, nag-o-orasyon tuwing alas-sais ng gabi, kumakain ng hapunan, at pagkatapos ay naglalaro ng solitaryo habang nag-nga-nganga hanggang antukin.

Tuwing panahon ng anihan, palaging hinahati ng Lola ang ani sa kanyang mga anak. Iniluluwas niya para dalhin sa mga anak na nasa malayo. Madalas siyang wala sa bahay nang dalawa o tatlong linggo tapos uuwi na rin kase marami na daw sha ulit gamasin.

Kasama rin sa kanyang routine ang pagkuha ng sulit sa lukad, pamamalengke tuwing tiangge sa bayan, pag-aasikaso ng amilyar ng mga lupa, pagbisita sa taniman, pag-attend ng meetings at hearings sa mga kaso sa lupa, at pagdalaw sa kanyang bestie na pinsan niya para mag-huntahan at mag-nganga. Tuwing araw ng mga patay, nagpapalinis at nagpapa-pintura din sha ng mga puntod. Hindi sha mahilig mamili ng kung ano ano. Ang mga damit nya puro patahi lang sa modista. Napaka simple lang talaga.

Eliminating the need to seek for a livable income career just means you can finally pursue passion projects or internal desires that you really want to do or to make a positive impact to your community, rather than just prioritize what will pay more, well at least for me.

I still go serve hot, warm, sanitary, affordable and delicious food for the students over at the canteen I manage, despite me not deriving the majority of my income there.

When you are given the task of running that canteen, and when you close down, the school will ask the students to take the rest of the day off because you did not operate, you get see your importance to the welfare of the children and how much their schooling relies on your service.

Nothing beats the inner peace gained that you are helping people whom have not yet been exposed to the real world, and that your small contribution to their lives has an small impact overall to what ultimately become of them. The idea that in your small way, you have helped them. That you are working not just to fatten someone else's coffers and advance their dreams or for selfish wealth creation, but ultimately to give back to the community.

I always dreamt of being an educator since I was a kid, and only later in life that I knew that I could apparently practice my dreams despite not really being a teacher in profession (my activity in reddit is also part of my personal advocacy to help strangers, and the anonymity veil just adds credibility to prove that there are no conflicts of interest)",108

mktuav1,1jomjny,t3_1jomjny,"Not speaking for myself but for my parents.

1. They finally pursued their hobbies.

For my dad, he got into restoring cars, golf, watch collecting, became an audiophile—usual dad stuff. My mom got into farming, art, baking, and teaching underprivileged children how to paint. What stands out is that they pursued their hobbies with the same vigor they had while working. They obsess over the smallest details and the minutiae, things most people would never care about.

2. They invested in country club shares.

Think Alabang Country Club, Baguio Country Club, and the like. This is honestly one of the best investments my parents made. They spend almost everyday in the country club. It's where they go for their morning walks. It's where they have coffee. They eat at least half their meals there. More importantly, it's a great place for them to socialize and make friends. 

3. They built a vacation house. 

My dad loves the water so my parents obtained a modest beach house. My father even got into the boating and would occasionally boat from places like Manila to Subic or in and around Batangas. My mom on the other loves the farm life so she would spend at least a day or two each week in the farm. 

4. They spend more time with their family and friends.

I always had a good relationship with my parents since we all worked for the family business. Now that my parents are retired (more like semi-retired honestly), they reconnected with their siblings, cousins, relatives abroad and in the province, and old friends.

5. Most days and weeks are the same

It may sound boring but my parents' live quite a templated life. They wake up, go to the country club, eat somewhere, play golf or tennis or some other sport, go home, and do it all over the next day. Yes, they have their hobbies and travel from time to time but they are content just living the chill and easy life and being surrounded by friends and family. Honestly, I'd probably do the same.",18

&#x200B;

>The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

mwapw8u,1l3tb2u,t3_1l3tb2u,"I used to be an insurance agent. Different company though most insurance companies have the same structure with VUL afaik. That's why I don't really recommend VUL in general.

It's like this, you have this 10-year payment term policy, but what you didn't know is that the first five years of your payment mostly goes to your agent, their managers, and the company. Tapos year 5 to 7, around 25 to 50% lang yung napupunta sa investments. Yung year 8-10, doon pa lang napupunta yung buong monthly payments mo sa stocks.

Life and health insurance are extremely helpful, and they also give you peace of mind if ever something bad happens, that's why I prefer term life insurance and pure health insurance over VULs.

It says mag start ang return around year 3 ata so you don't really get anything in the first 3 years and just kept paying. And at the end of 10 years the return is not bad pero it equates to saving with a little bit of interest on top. But I have stocks already and it performed way better than this. My 300k invested in stocks turned into 1.2M.

Anyway, if im not mistaken, insurance agents are obliged by IC to say that the lowest interest you can earn from the “savings-investment component” (whichever fund you choose) is 4% and the highest is 10% (ata, feel free to correct me baka nagkamali ako ng pagkakaalala). They show financial projections dun sa contract. They still show this even when the actual yearly performance is below 4%. Syempre umasa ako na tataas. Some agents disclose this, some do not esp if you dont ask. It sounds promising kaya scammy feels talaga.

The main issue here actually is your acquaintance who sold you your policy either overpromised or he/she genuinely didn't know what the hell he/she was selling and just wanted to sell..

One of the most important things we need to realize is that life insurance, regardless of which company you get it from, is NOT an investment.. It is exactly what it claims to be, which is life insurance, no more no less.. This is mainly the fault of the agents who over promise and continuously label certain policies with any form of withdraw-able funds that accumulate annual interest (usually around 2.5%) as ""investments"".. They are not, they are purely life insurance just with the added feature of having some of the money you put into it being available for you to withdraw unlike other forms of insurance like a car insurance wherein whatever money you've paid for it is basically gone..

Life Insurance again I would say is a must before you start investing your money.. I just wish these agents would stop overpromising whatever it is they sell because that's when it starts sounding like a scam even though the Life Insurance they're selling is objectively a good thing to have..",2

* Want a better government? Stop voting in traditional politicians! Vote in politicians with progressive and effective accomplishments, solid policies and an adaptive and humane outlook at governance. Dismiss once then ignore politicians who are full of gas-filled rhetoric, empty scheming promises and a push towards cult-of-personality fanaticism. Do the same with their supporters and propaganda pushers.
* Want less traffic? Stop buying cars! Find people you can share a ride with to and from work, bike, aim for and support WFH companies.
* Want cheaper, more sustainable food? Start a community garden, reach out to local producers, try a a barter system, find a local coop that is actually supporting your local community and not one that's only making money off your community.

The above is just a simple list but already anyone can see all the difficulties. Which is why it's the second best thing to do for a single person. Emphasis on ""single person"". A community needs different priorities.

mm5963h,1juv1rn,t3_1juv1rn,">I know freelancing can be unpredictable, but I currently have 3 stable clients. If I’m able to keep them until the end of the year, I expect to save 1M–1.3M, as I consistently put aside 80K–100K every month.

Dont count your chickens before they hatch.

>Is it reasonable to wait until I save 1M before starting to invest or would it be better to start investing now, even if I haven’t hit that 1M yet?

We don't know your monthly expenses, so it depends on your lifestyle and the amount you feel secured.

mm5jxri,1juv1rn,t3_1juv1rn,"Hey OP, we are in the same boat and I pretty much save almost half my income. The first million is always the most exciting one.

1. Pay taxes, I personally do for my peace of mind, down to every cent. I don't want any problems when I go back to corporate eventually (this gravy train ain't going to last forever). Plus BIR/govt agencies are starting to take action because they know freelancers like you get a good amount of money.

2. Take time for yourself. I was money hungry just like you too, but make sure you don't burnout. 

3. Have a scarcity mindset and only spend money you have. Freelancing is crazy and with the upcoming recession you can be dropped by your client easily.

4. MP2 is your friend. No tax and an interest rate of around 6% yearly.

5. DCA in stocks. I personally do crypto because the returns are better, but if you want something less risky you can go with the SPY 500. You can buy stocks at IBKR or GoTrade.

6. Utilise high yield savings accounts like Maya/Tonik for your day-to-day money. Daily yield might not be much but it adds up in the long run.

Congrats! Wishing you luck on your first million! :)",39

I agree with other comments, because of this you might need to be more generous of your monthly targets. Hence, don't count your chickens before they hatch.

Your plan seems to be pretty solid but aren't you doing so much? Short term this may sound sustainable but it will eat you up with all these hustles.

mm72kl5,1juv1rn,t3_1juv1rn,"Good to have your finances in order. I love these types of conversations as a personal finance girly myself...My 2 cents:

1. You don't need to wait until you have 1M to start investing. Investing works best the sooner you start or at least the sooner you understand how it works.

2. 12 months worth of your total expenses is good enough for an emergency fund. If you want more wiggle room, make it 12 months + 30% more of the total.

3. Good to have personal, career, and financial goals. Tama yan to keep yourself gritty and motivated. But you might also want to think about how you can relieve yourself from being the breadwinner. E.g., small business for parents, teach siblings (if meron) how to work similar VA jobs, etc.

With a fully-funded EF + an additional source of income that doesn't come from you + career dev plans, you might feel more at ease and less burnt out. 

Build your moat ika-nga.

Currently, part of my monthly salary goes to MP2 (10k) and around the same amount goes to stocks. 

I still want to reach 1M savings before I all out in investing but I’m also thinking this might be the perfect time to DCA while the market is down. So, I think I might consider adding to my portfolio a little bit during the year.

🙏",7
mm9j0vo,1juv1rn,t3_1juv1rn,"Yes! I recommend saving up the 1M muna before diving into investing. This will give you more flexibility for other investment opportunities later in life when you have liquid savings. MP2 is just one of those options

I think my current situation might offer some insights since it could feel like I’m your “future self” once you achieve that 1M in liquid savings

I’m 27 years old, also a freelancer, and I have passive income generating around 40k-45k per month with 3 clients, which brings my total monthly income to 300k-330k. I will be ending my contract with one of my clients this mid-month, so my monthly income will drop to 250k-280k. I’m also a breadwinner.

I keep my funds in three different digibanks: Seabank, Maya, and GoTyme. I also set aside 80k-140k each month for savings. If you’re not doing this yet, I suggest you start. It’s a form of investing, but with lower risk, which also means lower returns. Still, it generates some ₱₱₱

Currently, I have 1.2M in liquid savings. My traditional banks also hold several thousands (but not more than 50k each) in UB and BPI. I use UB for cash flow and BPI for car payments

Reaching that 1M will definitely give you a boost in motivation, but be warned, it can become quite addictive. I’m very protective of my savings since I’m the breadwinner, which means my risk appetite is practically zero. Despite wanting to invest in REITs, I simply can’t, there’s something reassuring about having readily available funds when needed

If you’re still unsure, I suggest keeping your funds liquid for now. Investing in MP2 is a good option. However, I’m personally not a fan of the fact that you can’t withdraw anytime, which is why I don’t have MP2. I prefer keeping things with digibanks. MP2 feels a bit overrated to me, and with everything going on with the government, I’m hesitant to lock my money up. This is just my opinion. For example, PhilHealth is in shambles, and I don’t find SSS reliable either, my grandfather, who was a driver, only gets 2k per month, and my deceased father, who worked in media, only receives 8K monthly for my mom’s pension

I’m also considering purchasing a farm lot soon to finally have some “tangible assets” and build something for myself, as I love nature

My point is, there are other investment options you may find enjoyable in the future. The best approach is to give yourself that extra flexibility by having the funds readily available, so you can use or invest them whenever you choose 👍",5

mm5so8i,1juv1rn,t3_1juv1rn,"halos same tayo ng earnings.

Pero to answer your questions, eto lang yung sa tingin ko;

1. Yes, mas ok na ma-hit mo muna yung 1M before you venture on MP2, think of it as baseline mo na i-mamaintain, because you never know whats to come diba

2. Sa books super ok yung Psychology of Money for starters, then 100$ startup, then try mo How to Win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie (its all about communicating with other people and how to speak objectively)",5
mm5yulf,1juv1rn,t3_1juv1rn,"So jealous of you starting your financial journey at 25!! You wont regret it! Time is your friend! Your money will just compound! If you think about it, if you save 100k monthly in MP2 starting now, if you keep reinvesting everything for 20yrs, it will be around 54-58M in 20years considering annual interest rate is 6-7%. 
You can also start investing sa UITF kahit mga 15k lang a month especially in s&p500 around 9-10% average annual return nun. Time in the market is better than timing the market :)

Wag mong itarget na youll have 1M before you start to invest. As long as you save enough emergency fund for you and whoever you support, excess should now go to avenues which will give you higher return that traditional banks (digital banks, mp2, stocks, bonds etc)",3
mm5z3us,1juv1rn,t3_1juv1rn,"Do you need money soon? Assess your aggressiveness in investing. Based on my experience last pandemic, I feel like this year is the best time to invest in stocks just in case Trump's policy will continue to drag the stocks all around the world.

If this is the case, you can buy them very cheap this year, then wait for a couple of years for the market to recover.

Say for example, you bought a Mutual Fund tracking the Philippine Index. If the Index falls around 5.5k this year and you were able to buy, and in 3-5 years recovers to around 6.3k, that's 14% gain. If you are more aggressive, you can earn more buying individual stocks (but make sure you know how to trade before dipping your hands in stocks).

But right at this moment, the cash is still king.

On the other hand, MP2 is also a good option since it's tax free and the income is good. Just don't use a big percentage in ""assuming"" you possible returns. Best to keep yourself grounded by assuming a safe 5% per annum return as your basis.",3

You could also start creating a file tracking your total assets - may it be in high yielding savings account, MP2, stocks, etc so you still see the 1M amount as motivation. 1M is the same even if it is in different asset classes. You could read up on asset diversification or portfolio management.

MP2 is a great investment vehicle but some people find the 5 yr lock up intimidating. My advice is to open an account immediately as in now na haha and just put a minimal amount while you are deciding how much to lock up for 5 yrs. As in kahit 500 pesos lang para ma activate. This way the 5 yr lock up is already starting, and maybe by the time you decide to put in a significant amount then hindi na 5 full years.

That being said, may options ka naman din to withdraw the money if you really need it. Also get a loyalty card plus agad if takot ka para may easier way ka to withdraw.",2

1. prioritize your health. if you get a chronic disease due to overwork, you'll never get rich and probably die young.

2. having multiple jobs won't get you rich. yes it will help you save some money but eventually, you need to get out of the rat race and dive into business. you have to take the risk but make sure that you've already did your research about the basics of business and risk management.

3. find your passion and think of ways on how you can earn from it. you'll never work your entire life if you're able to pull this off. if you can't find your passion for now, focus on what you're good at and start from there.

4. discipline and patience. don't upgrade your lifestyle yet. continue investing until you make it big. also, be patient as being rich won't happen overnight. it will take you YEARS of hard work, failure, and experience.

5. don't be afraid to fail. you are too young and have a long way to go. you can always bounce back. just make sure to learn from your mistakes, never do it again.

6. as an entrepreneur, this is the most important for me and i believe that this is the recipe for success. be humble and kind, never cheat just for money, always be fair.",161

mdaqn72,1irqo9g,t3_1irqo9g,"I got richer by adding value to my self. Going outside the cycle of the norms. I became a wild card, I became weird, i geeked out, i tried profitable stuff that are cringe to a normal person then I found my niche, found the same people who are in to my niche (you need a group, you cant be a lone wolf), you need people around you with different skillset and can do checks and balance with your actions. I made a team based on their skills and what I need then created a system. Nagulat nalang ako nag fflow na bigla yung money and may system/machine ka na na nagawa. 

You won’t become rich if you follow the road everyone took. Kaya may mga story to tell yung mga successful people kasi nag go against sila sa norm and found their own paths or you can follow the road those successful people took, blueprint na i align mo nalang sa current situation mo

Ayun, find your niche, find the people in the same niche, create a system, add value and find the problems your niche then provide solutions. Magugulat ka nalang. If mag iinvest ka tapos kakampi ka sa power ng compound interest, matanda ka na bago mo ma eexperience yung pagiging rich. If magiging wildcard ka habang bata ka pa, may room pa tayo for mistakes and if ever man mag scale you will enjoy it while you are young. Believe and manifest din that you can do it!

mdcg1pn,1irqo9g,t3_1irqo9g,"One step at a time, sabi ni Jordin Sparks. You cannot get rich in 5 years.

Take care of your health. Di mo makukuha ang mga pangarap mo pag nagkasakit ka. Kaya part of taking care of yourself is having emergency funds. Gawing motto yung tagline ng Clusivol dati.

Just because others succeed in business ay mag sa-succeed ka na rin. Daming factors, like the type of negosyo, the location, and your own strengths. You cannot open a fashion shop in front of a school just because uso yung clothes or you want to. Base it sa needs ng customers mo. If malapit sa school, either sari2x store with school supplies o kainan. I am emphasizing school supplies sa malapit sa schools coz not all students use powerpoint. May iba na manila paper pa rin ang kanilang gamit. Example lang yun. Base it on law on supply and demand.

If may tindahan ka, do not think of expansion agad2x. Make your tindahan work really well. Work with what you have. If waka kang kasama sa buhay, forget about expanding, lalo na pag 2nd branch mo ay malayo. Bibigay yung katawan mo. We can only do as much as our body can tolerate.

I will tell you yung napansin ko sa isang intsik na negosyante dito sa aming city. Yung school niya ay cheap kaya maraming nakakapag-aral. But that success of having lots of enrollees did not happen overnight. It took decades. Eventually, yung college nila was able to expand with many courses, lalo na medtech. Until such time na they could offer good pay and hire excellent talents para magturo. Not to mention na may other businesses under their group. But that is because, they are a group. Hindi yun effort ng isang tao, which is why pwede sila makakapag diversify. But that is also because they have the experience and started small. Or take the case of the Gokongweis or Samsung in South Korea. Both also started small but with experience, they diversified. Pero that is because marami silang tao para diyan. 

I am not saying na di mo kaya or wag mong gayahin kasi di mo kaya yung expansion or diversification kasi wala kang fam members who share your vision and ambition. What i am saying is, if may trabaho ka na pero gusto mong magnegosyo, start small. Tapos cultivate mo yung negosyo mo kahit nag-iisa lang yan.

Tapos do not spend needlessly just because may profit ka na. Yan ang hirap sa mga pinoy pag nakalasap ng success or profit. Pabongga here and there. Lowkey ka pa rin and invest in assets instead before ka mag splurge. Splurge once in a while, but not everytime pag may profit ka. Madaling sabihin pero mahirap gawin.

Yung upbringing ng simplicity dahil galing ka sa slums, bring it kahit may negosyo ka. Buti nga yung mukha kang simple pero marami kang pera.

Ang negosyo will take time to grow. Hindi yun agad2x. It's like growing a tree.

PS: if mag-iisip ka ng expansion, make sure gumagana na talaga yung first business mo. Pero make sure na yung first business mo, may mga reliable ka na mga tauhan. Once you expand, you know na the kind of people na dapat i-hire.",17

mded9qy,1irqo9g,t3_1irqo9g,"80k net? this is monthly yes? mukhang ok ka naman. Pero kung habol mo talaga eh mas malaki ang ma suggest ko sayo eh:

1. na try mo ba ang Stock Trading? May mga trading apps. Wag yung investment apps, lugi ka dyan at minsan scam yan. Yung totoong trading sa Forex. Google mo ang Top Trading Forex apps, hanapin mo yung tumatanggap ng International, yung may Peso. Wag yung Dollars unless may Dollars ka talaga. Pero pag aralan mo muna ang Trading, maraming tutorials dyan sa youtube.
2. Kung may lupain ka, Hacienda ba yan? Try mo mag benta ng produce mo internationally. Uso ngayon ang mga farmers na nagbebenta ng Bigas nila sa Japan at Korea. Punta ka sa Department of Trade, magtanong ka ng mga infos dun. Tanungin mo rin kung ano ang in-demand na produce na gusto ng mga Foreigners.
3. Kung gusto mo naman ng new Job, Hanap ka ng International Job online. Yung sahod na aabot sa $4,000-$7,000. Hanapin mo yung Home based work.
4. Na try mo ba ang Franchise tulad ng Jollibee or MacDonalds sa area mo? Check mo mga websites nila. Andun lahat ng informations nila for franchising.

Extra advice:

I am proud of you that you manage to rise from poverty. Ang advice ko lang sayo for building a business eh wag ka gumalaw mag isa. Isama mo mga kapatid mo sa business mo. Kung Hacienda ang business mo, hire mo ang mga kapatid mo as assistants, syempre sweldohan mo ah. Mag assign ka kung sino accountant mo, sino manager mo, sino taga bantay ng tauhan mo, etc. Kahit hindi sila tapos sa pag aaral, ang important dyan eh sila ang mas pinagkakatiwalaan mo.

mdd6epa,1irqo9g,t3_1irqo9g,"At 80k/month, you wont get rich.

You need to drastically increase your profile and income, in order to get into social networks that would open up new opps for you.

You need to learn how to spot role models and potential network.

To do the above, you need to earn more income and hang around people that have potential. (You need to start picking up good social habits and delete bad ones<--- super important)

If working a corporate job, focus on getting into the top MNC of your industry.
Look at job openings and JD's and ensure you try to have those qualifications.
Network around people that can open doors for you. (Linkedin stalking)

You will know you have high enough income when you can comfortably save 40-50% of your income.

At this point, you can start seriously investing and not just ""saving"".


On assets to buy.
Personally, i dont like real estate. Cheap land/condo is cheap for a reason. 
Expensive ones provide terrible returns. Sure, arbritage can be found, and if so good yan, but the ones that are ""retail"" price? Big no, for me.

I like stocks. I like reading about them, and people i want to be friends with are also interested in them.

On starting a business.
Unless you really really know the industry, i suggest you dont.

A lot of comments are overly positive, ang sinasabi nila, ""just find your niche"" ""take a risk"" etc. It may seem like that being rich only involes hardwork and innovation but you have to understand, being rich through business involve a huge amount of luck. You can be the most hardworking, excellent businessman in the world, but if the opportunities aren't there, you'll just end up failing and frustrated.. Actually, most billionaires na kilala natin got successful in part due to luck din., they had the right connections at the right time. some extreme cases like billionaires daw na hnd nakapag college is a matter of luck din, they were the first to discover a certain niche that will boom in the future. But the sad reality is, most of those niches are already discovered. The market is already saturated by services and products that a single search of something you need on google, chances are meron na gumagawa nun. Business is a huge risk and if may balak ka, you need to save up a big amount of money as buffer just in case that it will fail. IMO, the safest route and still get good returns in the future is investing through US index funds, bonds, high yield savings accounts. minsan nga mas maganda pa returns dun compared so other business minus yung sakit ng ulo.",5
mdk7hio,1irqo9g,t3_1irqo9g,"I’ve learned that building wealth is less about emotion and more about treating business like a game—one where the rules are logic, strategy, and cold, hard numbers. Early on, I made the mistake of letting personal feelings drive decisions, and it cost me. Now, I focus on systems, not sentiment. For example, I created clear processes for hiring, firing, and scaling, so emotions don’t get in the way.

Ayun after 1 year narealize ko lesson ko. When it comes to furniture, hindi siguro tatagal sa fam namin ung mga bagay na nabibili sa shoppee. Dapat heavy duty kahit mahal. So I bought a divider (kapalit nung coffee table) worth 13k (ang layo sa 2700 noh? Haha). Ayun solid wood. Pwede kopa ipamana pag nagka apo ako.",67

You have hp (health), mp (money) and xp (experiences). 

For the first 1/3rd of your life, it's the tutorial. You gonna make mistakes along the way but you will figure out that you need to learn to build your HP, MP and XP.

For the second 1/3rd of your life, tutorial ends and hard core mode begins. You work (farm) some gear, wealth and keep on building aiming for the highest HP, most MP and best XP as you can.

On the last 1/3rd of your life, suddenly you get a poison de-buff. Remember the first 2/3rd of your life building all that? Well, depending on how much you build it will dictate how comfortable/uncomfortable your final decades will be.",119

\--- This is very true, short story: I have a friend na Licensed Architect with a position as Executive sa isang local Developer, maayos ang lahat.. until she made a wrong call sa decision making niya. Me thinking na dahil Executive position na siya ay hindi ganun madaling ma-lay-off, pero again kahit exe ka pa hindi ka rin anak ng may-ari. Ending she lost the job, and being high-paid, hirap siya maghanap ng work ngayun na same rate.

Why??? Kasi andami ng bagong skills na ino-offer ng iba, all she can offer is her experience in handling big construction projects.   
  
Sabi ko wag kana tumarget ng local company, try MNC, engineering and consulting. Pero hirap pa din. sa mga MNC, the market is saturated with boat loads of paper certificate applicants at maraming company MNC na yun ang hanap certificates, more than experience, or at least you can sell your experience, you an verbalized how good you are.

Finally, what happens if catastrophe takes place, like loss of job, house, etc? The family has to use savings and investments to recover, and that's above the amount needed to attain basic needs. How much should that be, i.e., for savings, pension, health plans, insurance, etc?

That is why that if you have  a savings goal. After meeting that goal you keep moving the goal higher and higher. Its not the money/amount that is making you do it. Its the squirt of dopamine that you get from making little progress towards it.

inkmhoq,x8whpt,t3_x8whpt,"The thing is, the process of paying taxes itself is one of the most discouraging part. It is very complicated. Life is only at ease if you can hire someone else to do the filing for you, and it's definitely not cheap.

Nowadays, undergrads and fresh grads are perhaps the most common league wanting to enter freelancing, and paying taxes is something we haven't learned in school. It should be taught, honestly.

Lucky are those who are in stable amd regular jobs, usually, their company will do it for them. But for freelancers, you need to give an effort, you need to have the time and resources to register yourself.

I think, perhaps, BIR itself should reinvent itself and provide an easier system sans the red tapes. But they hesitate to do this because, with the kind of antiquated system we have, it is much easier to do corrupt deeds. They, indeed, make the process extra hard for everyone so we are forced to bribe them with gifts or money.

Not to mention, your own family will discourage you pa in paying taxes once you bring up the topic to them. Hays.

inkpv5e,x8whpt,t3_x8whpt,"I used to think like you. Nung nagffreelance ako nagbabayad ako ng tax voluntarily. Wala pa efps nun kaya pumipila talaga ako every month para magbayad ng percentage tax. Tapos quarterly at annually nagffile ako income tax. Kasabayan ko mga small business owners, canteen owners at mga puj operators. Konting late sa filing, penalty agad. Tapos maririnig ko na yun big corporations maglalagay lang ng suhol para hindi sila magbayad ng tamang tax. Pero naisip ko bahala sila basta ako ginagawa ko ang civic duty ko bilang mamamayang Pilipino. Nung nagkaroon na ako ng business at mas kumikita na, sinisita na ako ng BIR dahil suspicious daw un income ng company ko. Kahit sobrang honest ko mag file ng taxes at tama lahat ng dinedeclare ko na income. Hanggang sa hinaharass na ako ng employees ng bir para makipag compromise ako at bigay daw ako 2M para mawala yun made-up na violation ko. So ang masasabi ko, hindi ko mabblame yun mga freelancers na hindi nagbabayad ng tax. Napaka naive ng thinking na magbayad ka ng tax dahil yun ang tama. Oo yun ang tama pero responsibility mo rin na wag i-enable yun mga kurakot na nangungurakot ng tax ng binabayad mo. At sa bansang gaya nito, sino naman ang gaganahan magbayad ng tax kung mismong mga leaders natin at nag eevade ng tax. Kung sasabihin mo na “at least ginagawa ko ang tama”, tingin ko gusto mo lang iappease ang conscience mo. Nakakainis lang kasi na kahit gawin mo ang tama, hahabulin ka parin ng mga garapal na tax collectors. Favorite quote ko na nga yun “no good deed goes unpunished.” Nagbabayad parin naman ako ng tama pero mahirap mag judge agad ng mga small time businesses at freelancers na hindi nagbabayad.",65

While conversing, tax and govt contributions (ie SSS, Philhealth, etc) suddenly came up - sad to say, he never acted on those.

inkz263,x8whpt,t3_x8whpt,"As a freelancer paying taxes, I don't see why I should be hating these non-paying people. They are a product of a f\*cked up system, an incompetent government. If the government does even the slightest effort of making tax registration filing smooth and hassle-free, kahit ito lang, I'd agree pa sana with you OP. 

If these people (who btw worked their asses off to figure out things no one taught them) have this amount of money, their purchasing power increases. With that, they can create jobs to help the economy, they can donate to charity, and help other people and their families. If you have this buying and helping power, would you risk giving it to someone to 'manage' it kahit alam mong bubulsahin lang nila yan? Maybe, maybe not.

Yes, it's morally 'right' to pay taxes. But condemning these people when you know why they are doing it doesn't exactly make you 'right' too. Judging from your statement here, it's clear you want them to do the 'right' thing just because you're doing it too.

>Ako lang ba yung freelancer dito na down to the cents yung nilalagay sa columnar books and receipt?

There are a lot of wrongs in the system, and if that's their way of getting around it, pinaghihirapan naman nila yan, then I don't have a problem with that.

So they have no choice but to underdeclare to get them off their backs.

I'm afraid that freelancers could eventually be the new targets for corrupt foot soldiers in the Bureau once they notice how much money is coming in. And honestly freelancers have lesser means to protect themselves from this system. I understand doing the right thing but it won't guarantee you'll be treated right as well.
