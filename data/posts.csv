1jwi4cm,"My mom thought her P2M diamond collection would save us someday. When my dad got sick, we found out it was nearly worthless.","For 30 years, my mom built her version of a portfolio: Diamonds.


My mom is a housewife for over 30 years. She used a portion of my dad’s salary to buy rings, earrings, pendants - piece by piece, milestone by milestone. Weddings, anniversaries, birthdays. Over time, the collection grew. According to her, diamonds are ""forever"" and ""magandang investment kasi tumataas ang value.""


In her mind, those pieces were our emergency fund. Our inheritance. Our fallback.


She estimates she spent around 2M pesos total over the years.


She assumed by now, the value would've doubled to 4-5M pesos.


But when my dad got sick last year, we finally tried to cash in on this so-called ""investment.""


Nagulat na lang kami that the pawnshop offered us 35k for the whole collection.


Jewelry buyers from binondo and bulacan even warned us: ""Mam, this is mostly low-quality and non-certified stones. Hindi to pang-resale.""


She bough most of her jewelry from door to door jewelers like the good old days.


We tried to post it on Facebook Marketplace and Carousell but just crickets.


Some even messaged: ""Mukhang fake to eh."" Others wanted to lowball to 3k-5k per piece.


This made me do a lot of research and I learned about Lab Grown diamonds. These have entered the market a few years ago and became popular recently. They’re nearly identical to mined diamonds but cost only 1/5th of the price. Thus, diamonds now are nearly worthless. They also didn't issue GIA Certificates back in the day.


Some reports say lab-grown diamond prices drop by 10–20% per year.


Buyers now are smarter, savvier, and less sentimental. Most who are into diamonds know how to spot value, and they’re not willing to overpay for legacy stones.


We ended up with a beautiful velvet box filled with pieces we can't sell at a good price and can't rely on.


My mom thought she was building a treasure chest. Turns out, it was a financial time capsule filled with false hope.


I learned that jewelry is a poor emergency fund. Resale value is a myth unless you have rare, investment-grade, certified stones.


Grabe din talaga marketing ng diamonds, sobrang ingrained na sa mind ng most women.

Update: Gold is a better investment than diamond because it appreciates pero kelangan yung Gold is as close to the market price per gm as possible. Walang value yung design ng Gold no matter how intricate.

Update 2: Thanks to @futonn for this insight:

""I'm gonna say this as someone who was a manager in a fine jewelry brand where our main selling point was diamonds.

Diamonds have always been worthless. Their value significantly decreases the moment they leave the store, whether they're earth mined or lab grown. Some hold their value better like earth mined or certified stones, but a lot of the value is inflated because of the perception people have over diamonds. We literally have protocol of what to say when clients ask if earth mined diamonds are investments, we never say yes, we only say they hold their value better. This is why the same diamond with the same specs can have such varying prices depending on who sells them.

Diamonds are not good investments, but they're good heirloom pieces because they will truly last forever especially if you care for them. For real material investments just go for real estate or gold.

That being said, lab grown diamonds can be more expensive (in retail) than earth mined if the specs are better. Earth mined diamonds can be absolutely worthless with substandard specs.""",4065,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1jwi4cm/my_mom_thought_her_p2m_diamond_collection_would/,683
msyfhf,"Almost exactly a year ago from now, I ran away from home to escape abuse with 500php in my pocket. Today, I just reached 200kphp in savings.","UPDATE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/mtuefk/update\_hey\_im\_that\_21\_yr\_old\_college\_student\_who/](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/mtuefk/update_hey_im_that_21_yr_old_college_student_who/)

UPDATE #2: Omy okie na po ako sa awards hehe! Again this is a throwaway account rin po and I just wanted to tell my story. I do encourage you to make other people’s days by awarding their posts instead hehe. Quota na po ata ito hehe.


Throwaway because I don't want people to recognize me and I'm too shy and don't want to seem like I'm bragging but felt like I deserve to let it out.

Backstory: My parents are pretty well off. I was 20 and didn't even have a bank account because I was used to always just asking for money whenever I needed it. I never worried about money and thought I'd never have to. I was way too immature and was used to just spending all of my allowance buying food for friends (my weird love language) and since I study in UP, I sometimes also buy food for students who can't afford it from time to time. So even at 20, I just never thought about saving up for anything because:

1. I don't really want anything for myself. I wasn't into clothes, shoes, gadgets, etc. Just food really. And eating at Bonchon was already me ""splurging”. I just never liked spending for myself.
2. I was used to the idea that my parents will help me with money before I find work.
3. I really was just immature and sheltered in general.

Cringey right?

Well, that all ended when I was abused at home. I mean sure we're used to being ""physically disciplined"" ever since we were kids, but that time... That time was too much for anyone to handle. Let's just say my eyes and lips bled and I was kicked in the head (haha pun but yeah literally I was) and chest way too many times than I could count. Painkillers for a whole month after that. Also didn't help that I'm a girl, below 5 feet and weigh 40kg.

So with the help of my school and friend, I hid the clothes and things I could carry in a bag wrapped  with trashbag to hide them and ran away in the middle of the night. For a month, the professors and a dorm in UP helped me out. They gave me a place to stay and food to eat. Granted that by the end of it, donations were running out, and some days we don't get much food, so I knew I had to find work soon. I tried and tried but every call center and tutorial interview I took just lead to dead ends.

Until I found r/slavelabour and r/forhire. It was crazy. It was my first time earning anything. I was amazed and excited because I could finally get a bit more food. My first splurge was a bag of doritos.

I guess I was lucky enough that I'm a natural workaholic. I did everything anyone could ask me to do.

* Need me to photoshop this? Yeah sure u got it!
* Need me to code this? Yeah absolutely!
* Do you know how to do this? No, but I can learn!

I worked on myself. I learned all the skills I needed. I wasn't very smart but I sure as hell was stubborn enough to not give up. I survived *that* night, I damn well could survive the rest of my life. From working $2-$5 jobs just so I'd have something to eat each day, to only doing $40 minimum tasks after half a year. I now have a pool of loyal clients who ask me to do odd jobs on a regular basis and give work to schoolmates who need money during the quarantine.

I saved up, invested a part of my savings, and at 21, I just reached 200k and nobody except one friend knows.

I also just landed a pretty good job that pays 50k per month as a remote worker for an international company while I'm a student. I have three jobs, work in 4 different timezones, and try (my best) to balance everything with school and maybe sleep whenever I can (lol).

I'm slightly dying from overwork but for once, I can say that I'm truly proud of myself. And hopefully soon, I can finally be completely free from my abuser/what I went through once I save up enough.

Also just want to thank Reddit and everyone who was there for me for literally saving my life.

tdlr: My life turned upside down. But I said screw it and did the best I can. I’m an engineering student earning 50k per month now. Things do become better with time!

Edit: I really appreciate everyone who was worried about my health and I’ve been thinking about it the past few weeks too so I’ve decided to let go of one of my jobs as a virtual assistant and am asking my employer if I could train my friend as my replacement. Thank you po for helping me realize that I should take care of myself above everything else Hehe. Lastly, thank you po for all the kind words. You’ve all made my day and inspired me to work harder and be better as a person.

I will also find the time to post rin po about where and how I found work for all those who commented and messaged me! :)

Update: I’m sorry I can’t reply to everyone po but I’ll post a detailed post about how to get work po in a couple of days when I have time oo uli.

mtuefk,"[UPDATE] Hey! I'm that 21 yr old college student who was homeless, had 500php in her pocket, and now have 200kphp in savings after a year. A lot of you asked me how I did it, so here's everything I've learned from the past year. I hope this helps :)","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/msyfhf/almost\_exactly\_a\_year\_ago\_from\_now\_i\_ran\_away/](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/msyfhf/almost_exactly_a_year_ago_from_now_i_ran_away/)

Hi! Since I can't reply to everyone individually and received lots of requests from people especially struggling college students like me, I decided to post everything I've learned and done the past year that lead me to where I am now. :)

&#x200B;

**Did you apply for jobs and/or use freelancing sites like Fivrr, Upwork, etc.?**

I tried to find call center and english tutorial job openings through Jobstreet but kept getting rejected since I was still a student. I also tried to use Fivrr for some time but just didn't have any luck with it. I also found their fees on top of paypal fees unfair.

&#x200B;

H**ow did you find work?**

It all really started when I was looking through Reddit for homelessness during Covid how to's (again I was very sheltered and just didn't have any clue). I also went to r/assistance and asked for advice and told them a bit about my story. I was also quite desperate at the time since food donations were running out and the dorm was about to close so I told them that I'm a mediocre artist but if anyone would be willing to let me draw for them for $3 it would really help me out.

Surprisingly, more than 10 people stepped up to help me deal with the emotional trauma and gave me some tips about dealing with homelessness. They asked me to draw for them and refused to pay me unfairly and gave me more than I ever asked for. They also advised me to look through subreddits for paid tasks. This I guess was the start of me applying for Art Commission jobs through Reddit.

This was probably the most humbling experience I've had in my life because I've always been the person who gives instead of the one who's in need.

&#x200B;

**Where did you find work?**

Weirdly enough, just purely Reddit for the past year. Never applied anywhere else. The subreddits that helped me immensely were:

* r/forhire — The most professional and formal subreddit for jobs and tasks. Tasks or jobs here are usually for long term or have a specific durations that range from weeks to months. DO NOT ever offer or ask for low pay here. They highly believe in fair and US standard pay. The mods and community in general are very strict. DO NOT ever comment to apply. Message, chat, or email the OP depending on their preference. You will get banned if you apply in the comments. READ the rules. First time offenses will get you banned, no exceptions.
* r/DesignJobs — Same as r/forhire except it's focused on Design, Art, Photoshop, etc. If you know how to make logos and etc. there's a lot of jobs here for you regularly. Again, read the rules. First time offenses will get you banned, no exceptions.
* r/SlaveLabour — Mostly straightforward tasks with significantly less pay hence the name. This is what I mainly used in my first few months freelancing since I didn't have enough experience to have a portfolio or CV yet. But the best thing about this is that you can spend half an hour on a task and get paid quickly. Comment $bid on the post itself but to stand out I would suggest commenting ex. for coding tasks ""$bid I'm a computer science student and can do this for you!""

This might not always happen to everyone but like I said in my original post, I have a pool of loyal clients now and they all came from this sub. Since I did well on the first job and gained their trust, they gradually started depending on me for various tasks instead of posting on the sub each time they needed someone. (This is important) A lot of the times they also know that even if I don't know something, they can trust me to learn it quickly and be able to execute the task well so they gave me all the tasks they can possibly think of. Some of them I've had since June and I was able to negotiate my pay from the initial $3-10 rate to $40-50 per task depending on the difficulty and time.

* r/gameDevClassifieds — This was initially just for a passion project since by the time I found this subreddit, I had a decent amount of savings already. This sub is also mostly full of indie game developers so they ""pay"" you in shares instead of upfront. Whether the game will earn anything will entirely depend on the success of the project so this probably won't be good. There are some rare gems from time to time who offer monthly salaries. Among Us devs were actually hiring through this sub a few months ago. Will discuss this part by the end of this post.
* Other subreddits. I think there's some focused For Hire groups for writers, transcribers, developers, etc. too

&#x200B;

**How do I make sure I‘ll get hired?**

* ***Be active.***  Kailangan matiyaga ka maglurk. My usual day would be work > refresh reddit feed > work > refresh reddit feed. Why? Because you will have better luck getting the job if you're the first one to apply, especially on r/slavelabour. Also because I wanted to make sure that once I was done with my current task, I would already have something after. So join all the subreddits I've mentioned, Sort by New, and refresh every 2-5 minutes. Or if you're not confident enough for the other subreddits yet, Join r/slavelabour \&gt; Filter by ""task"" > Sort by New > refresh. Not too sure if there's a more automated way of doing this though.
* ***Sell yourself.***  This is how the client will know you're worth hiring compared to the others especially for the more professional subreddits. I usually refrain from copy pasting my messages unless it's for Art Commissions and even then I tweak it so it'd fit their needs. Mention one or a couple of things in their post and talk about it and sell your relevant skills. Also provide your name (A simple ""Hello! I'm \_\_\_\_ etc.""), your past experiences, link to your portfolio etc. No need for a formal CV unless asked for.
* ***Build on your portfolio.***  This is a must especially if you're an artist. At first I had a hard time with this because I didn't have much time for art before everything happened so I didn't have much to show them. All I had was my old tumblr blog I used as an art dump. It worked for awhile but I was offered significantly more and better jobs when I had my Portfolio (or CV if needed). Every time I finished a task, I add and update it. *You're building on yourself by building on your portfolio.*
* ***Every time you see a task. Always ask yourself ""Can I do it?"" and NEVER say no.***  Always answer with a ""Maybe"" but I personally prefer “Probably” just because it encourages me more, proceed to open google and search about the task (tutorials or videos or whatever you can find), and then gauge if you can learn it for the task. But DO NOT spend too much time on this (maximum 3-5 minutes) because if you really can't, you can't. You know yourself better than anyone but always be open to learning new skills. It will help you in the long run. This is probably the most important out of all of them and I wish I realized this earlier. I passed up way too many opportunities just because I thought I was only capable of drawing and a bit of programming. (ex. I never knew VBA in excel especially bec of its relatively confusing syntax, but it was a $50 job and I said screw it, searched, gauged if I can figure out, did a pretty damn good job at it. Another skill acquired and more sources of income!)
* ***Be willing to learn.***  Like I said, be open to learning new skills because new skill = new source of income. And the more = the better. A good place to start would be to check which tasks are common in your preferred subreddits. Don't know how to it? Learn it. Can't do it? Find the next best task you can learn. Don't stop, you can figure something out.
* ***Be trustworthy.*** The clients will know and will always come back to you.
* ***Be kind to yourself.*** Eat your favorite snack or watch your favorite tv show before working, anything that can help you feel great. Trust me you’ll work faster and better.
* ***Lastly, Believe in You.*** You’re capable of things. Everyone is. You just have to find the right thing for you. You will always grow no matter what so let yourself and actively work on it. Learn things and be things you never thought you could be.

&#x200B;

**Additional Tips:**

* For tasks that might take hours and have certain stages, always ask the client if you could work on the draft first and send it to them, get paid 50%, continue working, and then get paid the rest. If they say no, run. This is a huge red flag and I personally would not go for it.
* Stalk your client's reddit. If they don't have posts or their account is less than 10 months old, you'll most likely get ghosted after the work. Look for clients with a relatively active and old account.
* After each task always say something like ""Let me know if you have any more requests/work for me or if you need my help with anything else. :)"" This would help them remember you for future tasks. Make sure to be nice and memorable enough!

&#x200B;

**What jobs/tasks did you usually take?**

* **Digital Art/UI Designer —**  This, believe it or not, was a bit surprising because I was never really good at it and I was mediocre at best. Before running away, I actually debated with myself if I should bring my drawing tablet but thought of the possibility that it might help me somehow and gladly, it did. The hardest part was that I only ever drew landscapes and most clients wanted portraits of themselves. I had no idea how to draw people, let alone faces. But I did the best I can and worked on my skills, watched videos, searched countless tutorials. I practiced day and night until I got the hang of it.

Initial Pay per artwork (May 2020): $10-$15

Midway: $40-90

Now: $80-300

&#x200B;

* **Virtual Assistant —** This was actually a very humbling experience given that I'm again, sheltered and always saw myself as the boss (we were weirdly taught to think that way growing up and I was being groomed to take over the family company after college so this felt weird at first). I worked for an American student living in Tokyo lol rich kid problems for $5/hour with a $5 weekly base fee. I usually worked 7 hours per week. This was my source for grocery and food budget. I've been working for him since June 2020 and he's given me a few raises and referred me to other clients. So at the moment I'm handling 3 people from (Him in Tokyo, UK, St. Louis) before I could fully transfer them to my friend since I've just landed a new full time job. Hit a rough patch around January and tried to leave work but he ended up asking me to come work for him again after rejecting more than 10 applicants. Again, be good enough so your employer will gradually also be loyal to you.

Initial Pay (June 2020): $5/hour \* 7 hours + $5 weekly base fee

= $40 per week (\~8,000php per month)

Midway to Now:$7/hour \* 7 hours + $5 weekly base fee

= $54 per week (\~10,400php per month)

(Now I only work 4 hours per week though since I have other jobs and he adjusted as long as I don't leave raw lol)

&#x200B;

Bonuses:

Actually pretty funny because my client always procrastinates so he decided na every time he doesn't do something on time, he gives me money. Haha I never asked for it and I tell him he doesn't have to but he insists talaga so he feels accountable raw. We've become relatively close na but still professional since I manage his day to day life.

ex. ""If I forget to email this thing to you, I'll send you $50""

&#x200B;

* **Coding Tutor** —  This one started as just a programming task to help fix a guy's code for $20. I did it once, got paid, and thought it was done. But oddly enough, he just kept coming back and the pay doubled. This was kind of an intellectual achievement for me because I'm literally tutoring a guy older than me who's studying computer science in a prestigious tech school in the states. (sidenote: It's also healthy to boost your ego sometimes! hehe)

&#x200B;

* **Mobile Dev** —  This one also started as an html email job. Client couldn't fix it and needed it quickly for a deadline. Also did it once, got paid, and thought it was done. And then the guy liked me enough and asked if I could handle Wordpress mobile development for a Top Mortgage company in Canada. I said I've never used Wordpress in my whole life, but I've had some background with html/css/c/c++ and again, I watched tutorials first and gauged if I can learn it while I do it. He said he trusted me and that I could probably figure it out. I winged it and then I did it.

&#x200B;

* Other kinds of tasks ex. quick photoshop edits, fix my word docx format, etc.Ranges from $5-20

&#x200B;

**Where did you invest your money before you reached 200k in savings?**

* **Shopee.** I opened my own Shopee store for some time and sold through FB Marketplace. I found a supplier for macbook sleeves, had my own mini photoshoot in my dorm, created my own promotional materials, bought special packaging, and sold them for a profit. Reselling things for me aren't ever worth it if you don't make them any different from when you first bought them from a supplier. I was able to sell them each for 450php more. Was selling 3-5 of them per week.

&#x200B;

* **Crypto.** I was a bit late into it but I got in around January, enjoyed a very short bull run, until it eventually crashed and lost most of my profits because I was a noob. Decided to stop crypto trading for a couple of months, left them all in ETH and BTC, both went up so had a bit of profit. Day traded, which wasn't a super good idea bec a lot of losses but had a bit of profit again. Learned as much as I can, watched videos, tutorials. At one point, I was able to x3 my initial investment.

&#x200B;

**How did you reach 200k in savings?**

Like I said, I did a whole bunch of things. Maybe even too many probably. I'm a workaholic. There were days when I just kept taking in work that I earned $300 in a span of three days working on various tasks. Probably didn't sleep that time too. Don't worry I'll take care of my health better from now on na po hehe! I did stop working for a week after that though to recover lol. But yeah basically everything I've written here!

But most of the time my regular work each month was minimum 2 art works, regular VA job, 3-5 odd jobs.

Also don't forget to reward yourself from time to time. I usually buy milktea and food before starting each difficult task to motivate myself! I just think of it as my ""transpo allowance"" so I don't feel too bad HAHA. But it helps me work on tasks faster and better which lets me work on more tasks so ↗ Stonks ↗ parin naman.

Also risky so I can't recommend this too much but crypto has helped me up my net worth by a significant amount as compared to just keeping them all in my bank account.

&#x200B;

**How did you land that 50kphp/month Job?**

Again, since I've made it a habit already, I lurked on subreddits and found r/gameDevClassifieds around last January. It was really just for the experience and I never thought I would find anything there. Until I found this really really vague post about this game looking for a digital artist that pays 1000usd/month. Everyone was basically saying it's a scam at that point but me being the curious person I am, decided to reach out. Well... found out that the reason that they were being super vague is because they had to keep certain details in secret in preparation for their pre-alpha release on Steam on March 2021. I took the interview, spent days on the drawing test.... and then got rejected. Yep, rejected. And then I asked for another shot. I mean as a Stardew Valley lover (the game was close to SW + animal crossing), I just had to ask for another shot. And then I passed. But again, no openings for me this time. They said they'll contact me by March. Well, March passed and nothing. Basically crickets. I gave up on it. Regretted the full week I spent on the drawing tests. Was just so disappointed because I knew I would have really loved the job.

Until the second week of April at around 4am. They contacted me. And now I'm on my second day of working for them. 40 hours per week + acads are quite hard to balance. But I know I'll forever regret it if I pass up the opportunity to contribute to something this awesome.

&#x200B;

**How should I start?**

Don't be afraid to *start small* like I did. It's how you'll get to the top in the long run. Start with the small paying jobs, learn from them, work on yourself, acquire more skills.  *Move on to higher,  and greater things.* Grow as a person, grow your net worth. Good luck!

Edit: Since a lot of people have also requested. Here’s a sample message I sent to a vet looking for a Virtual Assistant ([https://imgur.com/a/PQftST9](https://imgur.com/a/PQftST9)). Again like I said, pay attention to the job description.

1. I mentioned my volunteer work for stray animals since she’s a vet
2. She has ADHD and but high functioning so I also mentioned that I can relate and understand what she’s going through And turned my weakness into a strength.
3. The job was mostly for emailing clients about scheduling but most especially, to inform them when their pet is sick or has passed away (huhu super sad talaga nito so personal messages are required). So I made sure that I mentioned and showed that that I’m an empathetic person and will know the right words to say to people suffering from loss not because it’s my job, but also because I care.

btw the first sentence was her requirement so no need for that unless the client specifies it’s needed

Unfortunately, I could no longer take this job since I just got accepted before she was able to have time for an interview.Hope this helps! :)",2628,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/mtuefk/update_hey_im_that_21_yr_old_college_student_who/,127
1i9wte3,PhilHealth and HMOs Don't Cover Everything - Here's How Guarantee Letters Can Save You Thousands in Hospital Expenses,"Quick Backstory...

I'm sharing this because of all the questions I got from my post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1i86wap/i_keep_hearing_about_people_saving_for_years_only/).



Shoutout to u/cessiey for dropping the knowledge bomb about Guarantee Letters (GLs) and how they can save you serious money on hospital bills. Honestly, I had no idea these even existed until then.



After reading their comment, I got curious, so I asked friends, Googled like crazy, and pulled together everything I learned about GLs. Now I’m sharing it here so that if ever you’re dealing with expensive hospital bills or just want to be prepared - you’ll have this as your go-to guide. Save this for future reference, kasi you’ll never know, di ba?


What Are Guarantee Letters?


A GL is like a promise letter from an organization (government agency, LGU, employer, or private group) telling the hospital, “Kami na bahala sa part ng bill niya.” It’s basically a way to get financial assistance without paying everything out of pocket.


Who Can Issue Guarantee Letters?
Here’s a list of the most common sources:


PCSO (Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office): Popular for helping patients with chronic illnesses like cancer or those needing dialysis.


LGUs (Local Government Units): Your city hall or provincial government often has programs for medical aid. 


DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development): Prioritizes indigent families but will consider urgent cases too.


Employers: Some companies offer additional medical coverage or can provide GLs through partnerships with hospitals. Private 


Charities: Organizations like church groups or Rotary Clubs sometimes issue GLs, especially in emergencies. 


Politicians: Senators and other politicians can also provide GLs, sometimes even to non-constituents.  For instance, the Senate Public Assistance Office facilitates medical assistance requests through individual senators' offices. 


How to Apply for a Guarantee Letter


The steps vary by agency, but generally, it looks like this:


Request an application form from the agency or group issuing the GL. Submit the required documents, usually including: Hospital bill Medical abstract Valid IDs Wait for approval. Some agencies can process this quickly (same day), while others might take longer. 


Pro Tip: Many agencies now accept online applications. For example, PCSO allows online submissions for hospitals in the National Capital Region. You can download the Medical Assistance Program (MAP) application form from their official website, fill it out, and email it along with the required documents to ncrmap@pcso.gov.ph. 


Contact Information for Government Agencies:


PCSO:


Email: ncrmap@pcso.gov.ph

Website: www.pcso.gov.ph 


DSWD:


Email: fo2@dswd.gov.ph

Website: www.dswd.gov.ph 


Senate Public Assistance Office:


Download the SPAO form here, fill it out, and send it with the requirements to the designated email addresses of the concerned Senators. 


Key Things You Should Know


It’s not just for public hospitals: Many private hospitals also accept GLs. Just check with their billing department first.


Combine with PhilHealth and HMO: GLs can be used alongside your existing coverage to drastically reduce your out-of-pocket costs.


Retroactive applications: Even if you’ve already been discharged, some agencies allow you to apply for a GL to help pay remaining balances.


You can use multiple GLs: If the bill is huge, try applying to several sources (e.g., PCSO + LGU + employer). PCSO prioritizes certain cases: They move faster for cancer patients, dialysis cases, and other life-threatening illnesses. 


Why This Is Important


GLs aren’t just for indigent patients - they’re for anyone facing unexpected medical costs. It’s a massively underrated option that can help you avoid debt, ease financial stress, and even save lives.

1gx20m9,Why my lola's sari sari store taught me more about finance that any finance guru could,"Just wanted to share a realization I had a few days ago that I think would be valuable to this community...


Nung 15 years old ako, napilitan akong magbantay sa sari-sari store ni Lola. Pinilit ako ng parents ko kasi gusto nilang matutunan ko raw ang value ng hard work. Syempre, teennager pa lang ako nun, ang gusto ko lang, chill at tambay. Pero ngayon, as someone working a 9-to-5 job as a certified corp slave napapaisip ako: grabe, sobrang dami kong natutunan kay lola sa tindahan. Dahil sa stint ko sa tindahan niya, mas maayos akong mag-handle ng pera kumpara sa ibang ka-age ko. Hindi ko rin ma-imagine kung paano ko kakayanin ang adulting kung wala yung mga tinuro niya.


1. Walang Cash Flow, Walang Asenso


Si lola, walang Excel o QuickBooks, pero master niya ang cash flow. Tuwing umaga, binibilang niya yung laman ng kahon bago mag-restock. Kahit piso-piso lang ang kita, alam niya kung saan papunta at saan nanggagaling yung pera.


Lesson ko? Sa buhay (at budget), hindi lang importante yung malaki ang kita. Dapat siguraduhin mong hindi mas malaki yung gastos kaysa sa pumapasok na pera. Kahit gaano kalaki ang sweldo mo, kung sabog naman ang paggastos, aba, good luck!


2. Small Moves Today, Big Gains Tomorrow


Sa sari-sari store, tingi-tingi ang benta—yung sachet ng shampoo, piso candy, o P10 na kornik. Akala mo, bariya lang. Pero sabi ni lola, “Ang maliit, pag pinagsama-sama, nagiging malaki.”


Ganito rin sa ipon. Kahit pa konti-konti lang ang nasisave mo bawat buwan, pag consistent, aangat din yan. Wag mong habulin yung ""get rich quick"" schemes - diyan natutulog ang financial heartbreak!


3. Kita mo nga, pero baon ka pa rin?


Si Lola hindi lang basta benta nang benta; alam niya kung magkano ang tubo. Kung tumaas ang presyo ng supplier, ayusin din niya yung presyo niya sa tindahan.


Life hack: Dapat mindful ka rin sa mga gastusin mo. Hindi porket malaki kita mo eh pwede ka nang gastos dito, gastos doon. Kung wala kang tira pagkatapos ng sweldo, parang nagtatrabaho ka lang para sa iba.


4. Trust is the real puhunan


Ang tindahan ni Lola? Social hub ng barangay. May tsismisan, may asaran, at may utangan (na minsan di na nababayaran, LOL). Pero alam mo, bumabalik ang mga tao kasi ramdam nila yung malasakit ni lola.


Lagi din sya nagbabayad on-time sa suppliers kaya nakuha niya ang tiwala nila lahat.


Real talk: Whether career o negosyo, huwag mong gawing transaksyonal ang relationships. Alagaan mo ang tiwala ng tao. Kung totoo kang may malasakit, babalik at babalik sila sayo - kahit hindi ikaw ang pinakamura.


5. Ipon Now, Luho Later


Meron si Lola na isang lata ng ""puhunan"" na tinatago sa tindahan. Para saan? Emergencies! Kung biglang nagmahal ang bilihin o may kailangang bayaran, hindi siya nanghihiram—may back-up siya.


Ito yung mantra niya na nakakabit na sa utak ko: “Kung walang ipon, paano mo babangon?” At totoo nga, kasi kahit gaano ka kagaling sa pera, may mga panahon talagang susubukan ka ng buhay.


6. Adjust fast or get left in the past


Dumami ang tindahan sa lugar namin, pero hindi nagpatalo si lola. Nagbenta siya ng mga di pangkaraniwang items - mga pasalubong na special o prepaid load nung sumikat ang cellphone.


Sabi niya, “Kung di ka marunong mag-adjust, kawawa ka.” Ganito rin sa personal finance. Hindi palaging smooth ang takbo ng investments o career mo. Kung hindi ka flexible, yari ka.


----

Sadly, my lola was too old to manage the sari sari store and she had to shut it down eventually. Then, my lola passed away a few years ago. My experience with her and the sari sari store will stay with me forever.


I’m curious if anyone here has similar stories. Feel free to share.

EDIT: Wow this blew up fast! Nakakatuwa naman na ang daming naka-relate! Ang saya basahin ng mga kwento nyo dito sa comments, parang naaalala ko tuloy si lola 😢. Tuloy-tuloy lang sa kwentuhan, nakakagood vibes talaga!

13e6tns,Everything I Learned Buying A House in the Philippines,"# Background

I bought a renovated house from the secondhand market via cash (DP + installment payments direct to the seller for 1 year). Yes, my husband and I are high earners, but we opted for a 4M starter home as I know that there will be extra costs in getting a house.

# Due diligence

* No banks were involved in the purchase. Next time, I will definitely involve the bank so they can do the verification themselves.
* **Reservation -** My first mistake. I really liked the property and paid reservation fees right away after 2 visits. This is stupid. You have the upperhand because it’s hard to sell a real estate property. Take your time in checking everything, negotiate for lower price and CGT to be handled by seller.
* **Property inspection -** As the house was renovated, I had to check the following: plumbing, electricity, pests, waterproofing, sewage system and water lines. Just ask ChatGPT on what to check or bring a contractor to give you an estimate of the issues.
* **Community issues -** I joined Facebook groups (HOA or buy & sell groups) to check the usual prices of utility bills, common issues with the admin, best internet service providers, flooding, crimes, etc.
* **Floods and fault lines -** I also checked Project Noah to see if the area is prone to flooding or will flood in the future. Check Tiktoks, youtube videos and facebook posts!
* **Property appreciation -** Future plans in the area were also considered, such as new expressways or malls being built nearby.

# Are you getting scammed?

* **Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) -** The seller may only have the TCT if they are the second owner. You should verify the TCT at the Registry of Deeds (RD) yourself as it only takes three days and costs Php 300 pesos. You just need to show photocopy of TCT, ID of owner and amilyar. Most people complain that the RDs have long lines but it's short if you're just going verification of TCT, unlike for cancellation or transfer of title. Don’t trust the agents on this, you have to do this yourself. The seller should have a version of the TCT called the ""owner’s copy"" with them.
   * If the title is really clean, there won’t be any encumbrances. If it's not, then it's not clean. Our title had a mortgage encumbrance on it, which made me worry. I went to a lawyer and he said that if they give a notarized ""cancellation of mortgage,"" that’s good enough and we can clean it ourselves.
   * Tax Declaration - They will show you the “amilyar” or the receipt to show that it’s paid recently. You can go to Assessor's Office to verify that. We didn’t go anymore because it’s just Php 1000 per year and we got lazy. Lawyer doesn’t need this, more on that later.

# Best way to pay?

* Pay via bank. The costliest way to buy a property is with cash, but I just moved back so I can't really take out a loan.
* A manager's check is recommended, especially if you're paying in millions. Don't pay with cash. This is as good as cash, and only the owner can deposit it into their bank. It's safer than post-dated checks too.
* Thanks to you guys, I learned that there's no limit to post-dated checks in the Philippines, so the balance is being paid in PDCs over a year.

# Legal Stuff

* **Contract to Sell** is created if the property is in installment and notary offices charge 1% of the property value, you can negotiate.
   * **Verify notary firm -** Don’t be cheap here. I switched notary firms because I don’t trust the cheap notary office they recommended - no Google reviews, new firm and they also have a coffee shop. We opted for a lawyer with a notary office who's been in the same building since I was a kid. Of course, he cares more about our interest and put a lot of buyer protection clauses. It's much easier to pay more for a legit lawyer than chase a runaway seller!
   * **Review all info before signing** \- Ensure that the title number, ID numbers, seller's and buyers name are correct.
   * **Terms** \- It should itemize all of the payment terms and all of the documents that the seller needs to provide
   * **Seller's deliverables:** All keys, old deed of sale from previous owner, notarized cancelation of mortgage, meralco bill, water bill, certificate of tax declaration for lot and building (those two are separate), TCT from RD, authority to move in. Seller will hold the owner’s copy of TCT until you’re paid or depends on your negotiation. Safest way is to keep it in a safe or add an encumbrance saying it's under a contract of sale, kasi they can still mortgage the property or sell it to another person.
   * **Move-in requirements:** It's important to check with the admin office or homeowner's association about their requirements for moving in and to ensure that the seller can provide any necessary documents or certifications during the contract selling process. This may include things like proof of ownership, water or electricity bills, clearance from the barangay or homeowner's association, and more.

# Transfer of Title

You should only get the DOAS after it’s fully paid or else you’ll get penalties as some taxes are due within 30 days of notarization. The previous notary wanted to issue this right away 🤦‍♀️ We'll probably just hire the same law firm to handle this for us.

&#x200B;

|Fees in transferring the title|Description|Deadline|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Deed of Absolute Sale|Additional 1% fee, executed once property is fully paid|Within 30 days to start transfer of title process|
|Documentary Stamp Tax (DST)|1.5% of selling price|5th day after notarizing DOAS|
|Registration Fees|0.5% of selling price||
|Notary Fees|1% to 1.5% of selling price||
|Capital Gains Tax (CGT)|6% of selling price ⚠️ Yes, it’s **6 percent** that’s why this is generally negotiated with the seller, let them pay for it haha. Most notary offices will execute DOAS showing half of the total contract price so they can save in the CGT and that’s completely fine.|Within 30 days after notarization of DOAS|
|Transfer Tax|0.75% of selling price|varies depending on municipality area, 60 days after notarizing DOAS|
|Real Property Tax (RPT)||Must be updated before transfer of title for payment of transfer tax|

**Make room in your budget for unexpected expenses:**

* This is why we opted for a more affordable property to allow some room for unexpected expenses. As you can see, legal fees alone can cost quite a bit.
* After closing, consider your furniture needs, then appliances, and finally any necessary repairs or upgrades such as a fence or window grills.

This was scary and stressful for us, and I hope this helps! It's funny, if we had just spent this much time buying stocks, we would have been multimillionaires by now haha.",2351,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/13e6tns/everything_i_learned_buying_a_house_in_the/,148
1hhue7g,Na-Scam ka na ba ng VUL? Here's what they're not telling you,"A few years ago, isang financial advisor (na tropa ko pa!) ang nag-alok ng VUL. ""Perfect to bro"" sabi niya, ""may life insurance ka na, may investment ka pa!"" Syempre, sino ba naman ang hindi ma-hype? Dalawang kailangan sa buhay - insurance at investment - sa isang hulog lang? Ang galing ng offer.

Nag-start ako maghulog ng P3,000/month. After a few years, naisip ko i-check kung magkano na ang “investment” value ko.

Akala ko naman medyo malaki na kasi ang total na hinulog ko was over P100,000. Pero eto ang masakit: ang naiwan sa investment ko?

LESS THAN HALF.

Paano nangyari yun? More details on that, later.

Kwento ng kaibigan ko naman:

She's a mom of two na naghulog ng P5,000/month for five years. Dapat daw, magagamit na niya yung investment for her kids' college fund. Pero nung nagtanong siya kung magkano na ang fund value niya, halos himatayin siya: less than P80,000! Eh P300,000 na yung hinulog niya. Nagka-trust issues siya after nun, hindi lang sa VUL kundi pati sa mga ""financial advisors"".

Saan napunta ang pera ko?


Here’s the truth about VUL na hindi sinasabi sayo upfront:

1. Malaki ang commission ng financial advisor


Yes, besh. Yung kausap mo, usually gets 40-50% of your first-year premium as commission. So kung naghulog ka ng P3,000/month, halos P18,000 sa first year napunta sa kanila. At hindi lang siya! Yung managers nila? May cut din. Kaya bago pa umabot sa investment, ubos na.


2. Ang daming charges:


Insurance charges: Habang tumatanda ka, mas lumalaki ang portion ng premium mo na napupunta sa insurance fee.

Admin fees: May fees pa for maintaining your account.

Investment charges: Kapag yung natira mong pera, pinasok sa funds, may fees din dito na kinakain ang returns. Kaya kahit kumita ang market, parang wala kang napapala.


3. Kapag tumigil ka sa hulog, goodbye pera mo.


Hindi totoo yung ""investment"" na iniisip mo. Sa VUL, may minimum na taon na dapat kang maghulog (lock-in period). Kung tumigil ka bago mo ito matapos, forfeited ang pera mo. Yes, kahit ilang taon mo na itong binayaran.


4. Walang guarantee kapag nalugi ang fund.


Ang investments sa VUL nakadepende sa market. Kapag bumagsak ang fund na pinili mo, lugi ka. At kung sakaling magka-issue ang company, hindi rin nila guaranteed na mababayaran ka—hindi sila obligated na i-cover ang nawala mong ""investment.""

----

Ang VUL ay parang toxic na relationship: ikaw ang bigay nang bigay, pero wala kang nakukuhang balik. At yung financial advisor mo? Kumita na sayo upfront. Kahit magka-loss ka sa dulo, sila safe na. Kaya nga tuwing sinasabi ko ito sa mga finance-related Facebook groups, ang daming nagagalit. Bakit? Dahil ito yung kabuhayan nila. Pero, eto ang tanong: bakit natin tinotolerate ang ganitong predatory practices?

Let’s stop normalizing these predatory practices. Marami pang mas maayos na investment like term insurance, uitfs and etfs na mas mura and barely any fees.

Kung may VUL ka na, reevaluate mo. And if you're planning to get one, pause muna. Aralin mo mabuti. Sa dulo, pera mo yan. You deserve to keep it. Wag mo nang ipaubaya sa VUL.

UPDATE 1: ang daming Financial Advisors na galit sakin kasi daw mawawalan sila ng kita dahil sa post na to. Pero honestly, happy ako na maraming nagse-share ng experiences nila sa predatory VULs. Tuloy niyo lang! The more stories we share, the more people we help.

UPDATE 2: Ang dami laging nagsasabi na ‘basahin kasi yung kontrata.’ Tapos parang kasalanan pa ng customer na hindi nila naintindihan. Eh diba nga, konti lang naman talaga ang nagbabasa ng kontrata? Aminin mo, binasa mo ba terms and conditions ng Gmail, Reddit, or Facebook bago ka sumali?

Alam din naman natin na hindi ganun kalakas ang reading comprehension ng karamihan sa atin. Kaya kung ang daming nagrereklamo na na-budol sila dahil sa false advertising ng FA, edi ibig sabihin may mali sa sistema. Dapat siguro gumawa ng mas klarong rules yung IC or government para lahat ng kukuha, fully aware kung ano ba talaga pinapasok nila.

Ang masaklap pa, ito din kadalasan ang ginagamit na dahilan ng mga nagtatrabaho sa insurance para i-justify yung mga naloko—‘Kasalanan mo yan, hindi ka nagbasa.’ Pero sa totoo lang, may responsibilidad din ang FA at insurance company na gawing simple at transparent ang mga terms.

UPDATE 3: What Should Happen (kung magstrictly regulate ang Insurance Commission):

FA: Hello, ma’am/sir! Alok ko lang po sainyo itong VUL offer namin. It’s an insurance product combined with an investment. Pero gusto ko lang i-clear na hindi guaranteed ang returns.

For example, kung mag-invest po kayo ng P400k, P270k na lang ang mapupunta sa actual investment kasi yung balance po ay napupunta sa fees and commissions. Nandito po lahat ng details sa dokumentong ito—please take the time to read it before signing.

Gusto ko rin pong sabihin na kung mag-withdraw kayo early, may penalties, at baka hindi niyo makuha yung full amount ng hinulog ninyo.

Kung ang goal niyo po ay protection lang, we also offer term insurance or life insurance. Mas mura siya at straightforward, so it might suit your needs better.

Let me know po kung ano ang mas swak sa goals nyo!

What Actually Happens:

FA: Hello, ma’am/sir! May investment opportunity ako for you na siguradong lalaki ang pera niyo. Bonus pa, may insurance coverage pa! Protected na kayo, tapos malaki pa kikitain niyo pag nag-retire. Eto na po ang kontrata - sign na dito!

See the difference? Sa tamang presentation, transparent lahat ng details at options, kaya mas informed yung client. Pero kadalasan, parang hard sell na agad without fully explaining the risks and charges. Kaya ang daming naloloko.

UPDATE 4: It’s crazy how people keep saying it’s just the FA’s fault, as if the insurance provider has nothing to do with it. Eh sino ba nag-hire at nag-train sa mga FA? Obviously, the insurance company. If there’s deception, they’re the ones who taught it. Ang dami nang reklamo, pero walang accountability.

And most of the time, the FA is a friend or relative, kaya kahit naloko ka, you won’t complain - friendship over or tahimik ka na lang sa family reunion.

Tapos people blame the clients for not doing research? Eh FA nga ang pinaniwalaan kasi ‘advisor’ daw sila. And then they say pinoys just want a get-rich scheme? Pero sino ba nagsasabi na ‘investment’ ang VUL? Hindi ba yun FA? Try dropping by a bank and inquiring about VULs - let’s see if the pitch is more focused on insurance or investment. Puro budol.

At the end of the day, pare-pareho lang ang VUL product, regardless kung sino ang FA - same commission, same predatory shitty fees.

The VUL product IS the problem. Yung mga FAs gustong gusto ilihis ang issue.

Grabe, after ko i-post ito, sobrang dami pala talagang nabiktima ng VUL. May isang tao pa na inuto na time deposit daw, yun pala VUL. Tapos nung nasa ospital yung magulang niya at kailangan na yung pera, hindi nila makuha. Ang sakit at sobrang nakakagalit isipin.

Masakit makita na pinaghirapan mo, hindi mo man lang magamit nung panahon na kailangan na kailangan mo.

UPDATE 5: From insurance employee insiders:

u/kur0nek0999

""I worked in an insurance company na may VUL. Totoo to. At most agents don't disclose these infos. Maraming nag cacancel agad ng policy once makita ung first statement. Sadly ung iba after cool off period na nacacancel so may loss na talaga.

Ang hanap ko nalang na insurance ngayon ay yung pure insurance lang. Kahit pay until specific age.

Just invest the rest of your money somewhere else.""

u/SnooPoems2582

""I work in an insurance company. Hindi sa insurance related department pero kasama sa requirements namin is to understand Life and Non-Life Insurance.

Computation is based also on age and yung risk. So tama na tumataas yan, and once nadiagnose ka ng critical illness, you can get your claim and hindi ka na insurable.

Agree ako kay OP, and natutunan ko yan when I entered the insurance industry. Critical na dapat naiintindihan ng clients yung mga nasabi dito, because all of it are true.

Below are some of the things I learned while working with underwriters / claims analyst:

Ang VUL should be sold sa value proposition na ipuput-first ang insurance, at hindi investment.

Remember that insurance is an expense at hindi investment. You are paying for your peace of mind by passing the risk sa insurance agency for a certain fee. Investment grows overtime, insurance becomes more expensive as time goes by.

Claims undergo evaluation ng claims analyst. Look at your contract na napakahaba, kasi nakasulat doon kaylan ka lang makakaclaim at ano anong bagay yung pwedeng magcause ng claim denial. This must be discussed IN DETAIL ng FA mo. Kapag hindi makasagot FA mo, hanap ka iba. Kasi ang magagaling na FA helps ensure maayos ang claims requirements mo para pumasa ka sa claims evaluation. They also help you manage expectation through clarifying everything from the start.

A good insurance company is measured sa claims ratio nya, which is gaano kadaming claims request ang nagagrant vs sa total claims request received. Ask your FA about this. Minsan kasi masisilaw ka dyan eh, may nakaclaim na 3m, pero ang tanong dapat is ilan ang nagfile ng claims na nagrant compared sa total. Makikita mo at maliit lang yan.

Lastly, mahalaga na insured ka, whether ano mang product yan, pero mas mahalaga na nainsure ka sa tamang product. Look at the list of critical illness covered, look at paano ang claims process, etc.

Shawtawt kay OP for this educational post at sa mga responsableng FA.

sa mga indenial, nako mag isip isip kayo kasi hindi araw araw you will encounter such post.""

UPDATE 6:

FYI: VULs come in many names, so double-check before committing.

Don’t be fooled by the creative branding. Always read the fine print and ask if it’s a VUL - huwag magpadala sa magandang pangalan lang!

First time we ever set out for an ocular in this particular village under Brittany, we were in love! At that time, it was surrounded by trees, fresh air, and there were barely any cars around yet. We took pride in buying this property and being a homeowner. 

Now, I completely regret buying this property, and all my neighbors share the same sentiments. Cat’s out of the bag, this developer decided to build a main road that will connect MCX to Villar City.  Right now, construction workers have been working day and night (and yes, EVEN DURING SLEEPING HOURS) just to get this project done asap. 

This property developer has NO respect for its buyers. Never even gave its homeowners a heads up regarding the plans. Never even decided to consult or discuss with the subdivision on how we can prepare and make changes. As it is, the soil here is already soft. Our boundary wall is currently sinking, and the rest of the homeowners are preparing for structural damages all because of this stupid road.

We’re already looking for properties to move to because our experience has been extremely disappointing. So please:

Don’t buy from them.

1j6qdhn,NEVER RENT TO FAMILY. Here's How Our House Turned Into a Cockroach Hotel After 10 Years,"Renting to family? Never again.

For 10 years, my aunt's family rented our 150sqm, 2 Bedroom w/ 2 car parking home for just Php10K/month which was WAY below market rate. (Sa area namin, similar units rent for Php25K - Php30K/month) 

Pero since family, pinagbigyan na lang namin. We also had no choice because our dad was the one who allowed them.

Wala kaming contract, walang security deposit, walang advance.

We finally needed the house, so we asked them to move out. I won't mention the details, pero sumama loob nila sa amin, and umabot pa sa iyakan at drama. We offered them another property, but they said it was a shithole (it wasn't a shithole, but I think entitled lang sila)

Then the real nightmare began.

- They stopped paying rent for the last 3 months. Walang bayad kasi daw ""pamilya naman kami""

- They refused to shoulder any of the cleaning or repairs.

- It took 10 days to fully clean their unit. The stench was putrid as hell. Any person would probably vomit from the smell alone. Amoy patay na daga, itlog ng ipis, and panis na pagkain all rolled into one.

- 2 truckloads of trash ang iniwan nila. They were hoarders. Hindi lang kalat kundi basura. Parang dumpsite.

- Sinks and toilets barado. Di ko alam kung anong binaon nila dun.

- Cabinets destroyed. Hingal ang carpenter sa dami ng sira. Puru mold, and water damage. Yung ibang aparador ginawang patungan ng pagkain ng pets nila.

- Cockroaches and rats INFESTED the place. Pati pest control napapikit sa nakita nila. We caught over 30 rats, and about hundreds of coackroaches.

- Total cost to fix everything was Php200k

I thought to myself: ""how can anyone live like this?""

After all that, sila pa ang galit sa amin. Kami pa daw ang masama. Ayaw na kaming kausapin. Wala na daw sila pera matitira kasi ang mamahal na daw ng upa sa iba with the same layout as ours. Wala din daw trabaho anak nila ages 40-45y/o, and magreretire na sila.

For 10 years, we gave them a massive discount (Php10K vs. market rate of Php25K–Php30K), no rent increases, and all the flexibility they wanted.

Pero nung kami na ang may kailangan? Biglang wala nang utang na loob.

Lesson Learned: If you own real estate, maybe it’s NOT a good idea to rent to relatives. Minsan, masisira hindi lang bahay mo — pati relasyon niyo.

I shared this story to my friends, and lahat sila may kanya kanyang horror stories. Common ba talaga ito?

I was really bothered by this, and couldn't sleep for a few days. I also had panic attacks. Mga pinsan ko from their family hindi man lang nagsorry.

jzlrcd,You're not gonna get rich,"To the redditor who asked how to get rich in his 30s through investing:

I hate to break it to you, but you’re not gonna get rich young with investing. The 1% is called the 1% for a simple, self-evident mathematical reason. So, don’t come here thinking you’ll strike gold in investing. That requires big enough capital in the first place.

Most investing is the preservation of wealth against the corrosive power of inflation over money. Wise investments get a little bit more. And time rewards that, but only after a long while.

If you want to get rich quick, create an enterprise or perform a service that fulfills a demand people are willing to pay big money for, or scam people – in the public or private sectors -- or be extremely lucky. If you knew how to do any of the three, or are willing to do any of them, you wouldn’t need the advice of any of us here.

The good news is, getting rich isn’t the point of life. It’s not a human tragedy that one is able to live a happy life with a happy family and fulfilling hobbies in plain middle-classness. One doesn’t always have to be in the cream of the crop. If, at the end of a well-lived life, one is eulogized with “he wasn’t rich, but he lived comfortably enough to be a decent and happy person,” that’s not such a bad way to go.

Happiness is a function of contentment, not money. That's why you should keep your expectations reasonable. Now, of course, there is a level of financial status that makes for valid discontent. And there is certainly a level of comfort that money buys. Above that level, every additional peso gets marginally less enjoyable than the previous peso. I'm personally worth something in the low eight figures (much of it not my own doing and not by my own merit). But I never bought myself any gadget or personal luxury above 30k. I'm just happy I get to buy myself a nice bowl of bulalo when I want one. Money has its limits when it comes to making one happy.

Investing is the passive accumulation of wealth over a lifetime. Time rewards correct decisions with dignified old age. Sometimes, you do get rich with investing – at 60 or something, after more than a generation of correct and patient decisions.

Now just because you can’t get rich doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest. The alternative – an unprepared life – is awful. Keep your expectations reasonable but your efforts excellent. I assure you, you will exceed your expectations and be all the happier for doing so. Learn on your own. We at r/phinvest can be good sources of “leads,” but otherwise, you’re on your own, dude.

I’m sure all of us wish you well, though. So, you can count on our goodwill, our friendship, and our advice.

1iwkpl2,The Art of Ejecting Squatters: Read This If You Inherit Unwanted Tenants,"Noong una, akala ko ang pinaka-stressful na part ng real estate investment ay ang pag-ipon ng pang-downpayment. Mali pala ako. Mas mahirap pala ang bawiin ang mismong lupa mo — dahil may ibang taong nauna nang tumira doon.

Ganito nagsimula yung gulo namin.

# Ang Lupa Na May Libreng Pamilya

Matagal nang may biniling lupa ang parents ko. Hindi nila natirhan agad, pero bayad lahat—title, tax, etc. Fast forward years later, sabi ng parents ko, “O, anak, ayusin mo na ‘yung lupa. Pwede nating i-benta or pa-upahan.”

So pumunta ako para tignan ang property. Dala ko pa ‘yung mindset na “Aba, ito na ang unang hakbang sa pagyaman!”

Pagdating ko, may bubong. May pader. May kurtina. May tao.

Nagkatinginan kami nung lalaking nasa harap ng bahay. Ako, nagtataka. Siya, parang defensive agad.

“Sino ‘yan?” tanong ng babae sa loob.

Ako dapat ‘yung nagtatanong niyan, diba?

Sabi ko, ""Boss, sa amin po itong lupa. Kailan pa po kayo nandito?""

""Matagal na.""

Aba. Ang confident.

Sabi ko ulit, ""Eh alam niyo bang may may-ari ‘to?""

""Eh kasi iniwan lang naman ‘to ng matagal, eh.""

Ay, ganun pala ‘yun? So pag iniwan ko ‘yung kotse ko sa parking ng SM ng isang taon, kanila na?

# Ang Pakiusap Na Walang Nangyari

Sinubukan kong dumaan sa maayos na usapan. Baka naman pwede nilang intindihin na kailangan na namin gamitin ‘yung lupa.

""Wala po kaming ibang matutuluyan.""

‘Yan na. First line of defense palagi.

So dinala ko sa barangay. Ang ini-expect ko, makakatulong sila sa pag-facilitate ng tamang proseso. Ang nakuha ko?

""Pag-usapan niyo na lang po.""

Walang kwenta. Walang nangyari. Tatlong beses akong pabalik-balik sa barangay para lang marinig ‘yung parehong sagot.

Doon ko na-realize, walang mangyayari dito. Kailangan na ng abogado.

# Ang Totoong Laban: Magkano Ba Ang Ejectment Case?

Nagpa-consult ako sa abogado. Sabi niya, may proseso ‘to - file ejectment case, serve notice, hintayin ang court order. Madali lang sa papel. Pero sa totoong buhay? Walang madali.

**Gastos Breakdown (Approximate):**  
**- Lawyer’s acceptance fee:** ₱50,000 (Kahit basic case, mahal talaga)  
**- Filing fees:** ₱10,000  
**- Sheriff & court-related fees:** ₱7,000  
**- Miscellaneous (affidavits, documents, notarization, pamasahe sa hearings, etc.):** ₱5,000-₱10,000  
**- Lost time and stress:** *Priceless* 😭

Total na **mahigit ₱70,000** para bawiin ang **sarili mong property**. Samantalang sila? Libre silang nakatira for years.

# Ang Tagal ng Proseso: Bakit Ganito Kahirap?

Ejectment cases usually take 6 months to 1 year, pero sa amin? Halos 1 taon!

* **1st month:** File ng complaint, waiting game para sa first hearing
* **2nd-5th month:** Barangay mediation (Walang nangyari, puro palusot)
* **6th-10th month:** Court proceedings, attend hearings, hintay ng decision
* **11th-12th month:** Final court order + execution (saka pa lang napilitan umalis)

Halos isang taon, tapos ₱70K ang gastos, at ilang leaves sa trabaho ang nasayang para lang mapaalis ang hindi dapat nandiyan in the first place.

At kahit may court decision na, hindi pa rin sila agad umalis. Kailangan pang dumating ang sheriff, kasama ang pulis, para tuluyan silang mapaalis.

Noong araw na ‘yon, nakita ko silang nag-iimpake, tahimik lang, walang drama. Wala na ‘yung galit, wala na ‘yung sigaw. Kasi wala na silang laban.

At doon ko naisip: **Hindi pala ako masama. Tama lang talaga ako.**

# Para Sa Mga May Ganitong Problema, Eto Ang Natutunan Ko:

**- Huwag maghintay.** The longer they stay, the harder it is to eject them.  
**- Legal agad.** Barangay settlements rarely work; ejectment case ang tunay na sagot.  
**- Huwag magpa-awa.** Hindi ikaw ang kontrabida dito, ikaw ang may-ari.  
**- Secure your property.** Kung may bakanteng lote kayo, ipa-fence niyo na agad. Prevention is better than eviction.

Akala ko dati, basta may titulo ka, wala ka nang iisipin. Mali pala. Sa Pilipinas, ang tunay na laban ay hindi lang sa pagbili ng property kundi sa pagprotekta nito.

So kung may lupa kayong matagal nang iniwan, check niyo na. Baka may “bonus tenants” na rin kayo.",1628,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1iwkpl2/the_art_of_ejecting_squatters_read_this_if_you/,241
1g0iz4y,UPDATE: Launched a Salon at the end of January. ₱3.5M in Sales; ₱1.1M Net Year-To-Date,"For anyone who missed my original post you can find it [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1d84qaz/launched_a_salon_at_the_end_of_january_this_month/).

I've been meaning to put together an update for a few weeks but have been pushing it off. Mostly because I'm not quite sure how to structure these updates. I think the original post was relatively thorough on our start up process and how we gathered sales, at this point I don't think things will get a lot more interesting. So what I think might be fun to do is to include a bunch of lessons I learn as I grow this salon with my co-owners.

Just like last time, I'm posting to brainstorm idea and help others who are looking to get started. Ask away as much as you want and share any insights that you have.

Jumping right into what people care the most, the numbers!

*^(\*numbers in table are rounded off to make it fit.)*

|May|June|July|August|September|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sales|₱406,700|₱591,500|₱504,700|₱574,900|₱581,000|
|Expenses|-₱253,527|-₱352,863|-₱295,512|-₱403,652|-₱455,838|
|Profit|₱153,173|₱238,637|₱209,188|₱171,248|₱125,162|

I left off my last post slightly worried about rainy season and months people call ""Ghost"" months, but as you can see, there definitely weren't any ghosts around for us. In fact, May to June was our largest jump in sales so far increasing by 45.5% MoM.

Honestly nothing really out of the extraordinary happened during July except for a larger push on advertising. I mentioned in my last post that I was looking to remarketing to old customers which didn't happen, honestly it just kind of slipped my mind in June.

# July

This is where things started to get interesting because it was our first month where sales were lower than the month before. Couple of things contributed to the downtrend in sales from what I could tell:

1. Our CAC (customer acquisition cost) spiked significantly going from ₱324 to ₱409. Feeding into this was a decrease in efficiency from our ads, it cost us more to get people into our funnel which in turn made the conversion cost a lot more. Honestly this was my fault which leads me to my first lesson.

**Lesson 1: Don't be complacent**

From Jan to mid April I pushed really hard on making sure I get plenty of creatives for advertising, whether it is a new video concept, more images etc. I made a rookie mistake and just paused the flow of creatives available for advertising to me, this also meant organic posts stopped. I kept telling myself ""next week, next week"", well, weeks turned into months and before I knew it, ads started to fatigue, costs started to shoot up and I was now playing catch up trying to create as much content as possible. I've since asked the team to help me create more videos and images on a consistent basis.

2. Coming out of May's busy month of graduations, mother's day and other events, I was really surprised our internal metrics remained all the same in June but I really felt the downtrend in demand in July where people seemed interested, but didn't convert. Our average conversion rate up until July was around 7.5%, that dropped down to 4%.

3. The weather sucked - and continued to suck for August and September with all the rain and typhoons people just didn't want to go and I don't blame them.

4. Customers didn't avail of as many high ticket services. Prior to July, our average value per customer stepping into the salon was about 2.35K in June that dropped down to 2K in July. It doesn't sound like a lot but if enough people show up those ₱350 that are missing gets noticed. Honestly, not sure why it happened, I talked to our hairdressers if they noticed anything odd for July but everything seemed normal. One thing I noticed on the data side is a significant drop in ""Balayage"" hair color services (at the time our highest ticket item), a drop of more than half while our ""cheaper"" lower end packages were availed more.

So how did we increase sales after July when fewer people showed up, their value dropped and it was more expensive to advertise?

**Lesson 2: It's easier to increase revenue by selling higher ticket services to your customers than it is to increase the number of new customers.**

So to reference some quick numbers,

|Month|No. of customers|
|:-|:-|
|**July**|245|
|**August**|246|
|**September**|219|

Notice how in August we had almost the same number of customers as July but sales were ₱70K higher in Aug. It's even more obvious when you look at September numbers, our CVR dropped, we saw 10% drop in number of customers but revenue increased MoM by ₱7K.

Essentially what happened is we started looking for higher value services we could offer and stumbled upon a product that's relatively popular in Manila but not as much where I live. It's a premium product that's about 30% higher in value than our other services.

So how do we convince customers to buy the premium services? We just ask them lol. We put a lot of emphasis on explaning why it's better, what the benefits are and even have before/after pictures of our past customers to help convince them. Most people want beautiful hair and if they're willing to spend 2.5K on a basic package, it's not too hard to  ask them for an additional 1k for a premium option and later on additonal 500 for something else, so it snowballs sometimes.

This new product also happens to be perfect for people we would typically have to reject due to their hair status. If someone shows up with ""unhealthy"" hair, there really isn't much we can do in terms of straightening or coloring, it'll just further damage the hair, but with this product we're able to help start the recovery process while also getting pretty close to what they're looking for.

# August & September

We started to bounce back despite the rain and weather not being on our side. Really the only thing that saved us from what should have been terrible months for us was that new service.

During these months we also decided to hire 3 new people. 2 Sr. hairstylist and 1 hair wash boy.

We are getting ready for the ""Ber"" months rush, historically from the original branch they see up to 20 people a day in November and December, knowing this we wanted to be proactive and bring on people who could help us handle the additional customers. This is also why you'll see a drop in profit during these months

But with new staff come new problems.

**Lesson 3: Owning a business is more about managing the people than it is to drive sales.**

Now this one is obvious but I never realized what a pain it can be to deal with your staff and/or customers. At the end of the day our staff makes you your money but oh my god can they be petty. It sometimes feels like I'm back in highschool the way they treat each other.

We've had situations where people just don't like and ignore the manager (one of the owners). Staff having arguments over accidentally bumping into each other, people ""Utusing"" each other to the point they weren't working anymore.

It's still something we're working on but I think a big part of it is how staff is handle by the manager. Nearly every month I hear issue about favoritism, show off, ""puro utos"", initially I thought people were just petty but it looks like it's a pattern. I think he lacks the people skills to be an effective leader but on the other hand I wouldn't want him to step down since he's the money maker at the salon, upselling and cross selling anyone he can accounting for probably 30% of our revenue,  he just lacks the management skills. It also doesn't help that everyone's related to each other working at the salon so things get personal sometimes.

# So what's next?

For the salon we're looking to hit ₱1M/month, hopefully by November so we can repeat it in December. Metrics are looking really strong month-to-date to support scaling and hitting our ₱850K sales target for October.

One thing I want to figure out is how to send out mass texts similar to how Landers does it. I'm looking to transition our customer forms from pen and paper to an iPad where people can opt-in to receiving these messages (people have terrible handwriting lol).

We tried remarketing to existing customers manually through text and messenger, however it's not been as successful as I hope it would be. It was also extremely time consuming which is not something I wanted to push over to our admin. We're currently looking for a tool that lets your send mass texts like Landers or ""TheFreelanceMovementtribe""(TFMT). I think we can hit our ₱1M a month goal if we have the right tools, so if anyone knows anything about this topic, hit me up!

Personally, I'm on the look out for businesses that are open to a marketing partner and are local to my area. I've started making offers here and there and I'm currently in the works of potentially buying into a beauty spa but I will keep you posted on that.",1470,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1g0iz4y/update_launched_a_salon_at_the_end_of_january_35m/,155
13vc18u,You guys did this to me with your advices..,"Hi! So I have posted multiple times here for the purpose of seeing different perspective, opinions, and advices + also reading other threads.

With your comments I was able to get a more comfortable lifestyle in which sets me up to my plans.

- 2 years ago, you guys taught me how to build an EF in which I have now

- 2 Years ago you guys taught me about budgeting and keeping track of my expenses. (I’m a spreadsheet expert now jk)

- 2 Years ago you guys made me realize that VUL is not worth it so I went for a whole life trad plan instead that I can just pay for 10-20 years.

- 1 and a half Year Ago you guys taught me about cost averaging in stocks so I already have that right now monthly for US ETFs

- 1 Year Ago, you guys gave me a better way to decide which career path should I take and have more growth and I have decided to take that.

- 6 months ago you guys gave me a better perspective of my situation right now that I am okay despite feeling demotivated and left behind.

- 2-4 months ago you guys gave me a solid decision to spend more for a comfortable place in which I am living right now. I never felt so motivated having a better home, fresh air, windows, great community for me and my pets. Still saving big even after this!

Just wanted to say thank you to everyone. This community means a lot to me as I have no one to turn to for advices re finance and life decisions.

Overall, I have a better income, a good investment, a better career, and a more comfortable and safe home. 

One lesson I learned all throughout different advices regarding lifestyle?

Living frugally like really buying CHEAP THINGS just to save will make you spend more as your physical and mental health deteriorates.

Spending more for a 10-20% for your comfort of living will save you from getting burnt from everything. It will keep you living FRUGALLY PROPERLY.

I believe living frugally and living frugally properly are 2 diff things. The other one is like not buying medicine when you need it.

It varies from having your own place, getting better and healthy food, buying things that entertains you while you rest, or anything that can make you recharged with what you do from day to day

I hope you guys continue to help out people like me.

Cheers to everyone!


EDIT: Just adding because when I was living frugally in which NOT THE PROPER WAY; where I was demotivated and uninspired. I spent more money because I want to go on vacations frequently, spa, anything expensive that can distract me and feel like this can recharge me to work but then I realized going back to my actual lifestyle and home would just give that uninspired vibe back again. Now I spent more in my home for rent (Since I moved out) but I don’t have to go on vacations frequently or treat myself outside. My home is my safe space in which I can rest and relax! I got a better mattress, a better pillow etc. haha and I can swim downstairs and use the gym! Yay!

STILL PLANNING TO TRAVEL OFC! That’s a diff thing lol",1468,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/13vc18u/you_guys_did_this_to_me_with_your_advices/,98

w097nu,"""beat the inflation"" ???? tangina???","i'm sick and tired of seeing these financial literacy groups advocating ""tips"" on how to ""beat"" the rising inflation

bitch, you can't beat inflation, all you can do is persevere until it subsides and hope for the best that your expenses won't choke you.

these tips were followed and done way even before this recent inflation.

1. ""Increase Your Income""

dude, how i wish i could find a way to increase my income, sino ba naman hindi gusto ng ganito

sadly, your average 9-5 juan can't find another side hustle, since he has a family to take care of and other factors that hinders him/her on doing so

not everyone can just ""increase their income"" fuck you.


2. ""Track Your Expenses""

i do track my expenses, thank you very much

pero anong gagawin ko if my 1.5k budget for groceries becomes a budget of 2-3k because of this inflation

paano ko iccontrol yung expenses ko eh basic necessities na nga pinagkkasya ko 

titignan ko nalang yung money tracker app ko na naka nga nga???

3. ""Reduce Expenses"" 

well, fuck. can't say this isn't the holy grail of advice na sinasabi way even before this shit of an inflation began

ang hirap na ngang ibudget yung already adjusted expenses tapos magrreduce pa??? 

hays, fuck, shit, fuuuuuuuuuuck.

nakaka bobo 'talaga to'ng mga financial literacy groups amp

common sense na yung mga sinabi sa taas na ""tips"" and you can apply these way before the inflation.

you can't ""beat"" this shit, you just have to grit your teeth and hope for the best that it won't fuck you, or anyone else that you know of over.

the system is designed for us to stay at the bottom of this fucking barrel. you think that by applying these tips can easen this uneasy feeling? fuck.

i'm sorry, i know that these guys don't mean no harm pero let's face it

you can't ""beat"" this inflation by hustling your way out of it

most of us has hustled long before and you're meaning to tell me to just keep on hustling? 

you can't call that ""beating"" the inflation, my man.

oqk0f2,Unpopular Opinion: Financial Literacy won’t make you wealthy if you aren’t making enough money in the first place,"[Inconvenient Truth](https://imgur.com/gallery/0Vmflrf)

It’s good to live below your means, save diligently, and invest wisely. But if you’re not making enough, no matter how responsible you are with money, you’re just one bad emergency away from getting wiped out.

Sometimes, you’re not even able to make enough to build sufficient savings and insurance coverage since rent, utilities, and bills already eat up most of your income.

There are a lot of young people in this sub and I just want to reemphasize that **it’s important to build your income stream to enable you to save, invest, and build wealth in the long term**. You can go abroad, find a virtual job that pays in USD, build a business, or do very well in your local employment and climb the corporate ladder.

It’s unlikely that the Philippines will become a first-world country within our lifetime, so don’t expect a rising tide that lifts all boats.

1kgy5n6,Revelations as a former Financial Advisor (Insurance Agent) of Pru Life UK,"✅Upto 100% of what you pay for your VULs in the first year goes to the sales force. This means that instead of your money earning interest, your money goes to the commission of your sales agent, their managers, and whoeverelse are on top. To validate this, you may check your policy booklet /quotation. You'll notice that nothing goes to your investment. For some plans with higher monthly premiums, they put a small amount in the first year few years, and not zero. For most plans, the commission payment only stops on the 5th year.

✅They get commission from your monthly payment for Upto 5yrs for certain types of plans. For some plans with higher premiums, this may be shorter. So your money isn't growing, they use it to fund their luxurious out of the country escapades.

✅In the event that you cancel your plan in the first few years, you won't be able to get the full amount of your fund value. They'll deduct a huge portion for not finishing the period of payment.

✅Many agents do not actually know what they are selling you. They are selling insurance but they are made to believe that they are helping their clients prepare for retirement or prepare for their children's college education. Why on earth would you buy a life insurance plan for your child's college education? 

✅Agents are trained to respond to your objections. If you want to stay away from FAs, just stick with a plain and simple NO. If they probe further, say that they are making you uncomfortable and change the topic. If they still insist after this, then I think you know better than entertain them.

✅To the sales agents of Prulife, especially the Alexandrite district in Makati, they'll make you sign a document that you have to resign of you don't hit your quota. Not all branches do this, but this particular district (what they call their sales group in a particular location) is greedy and evil. Since you may still receive your sales commission from the company even after you don't hit the quota set by the branch, the branch will pressure you to submit your resignation letter. This will ensure that all your future commission will be forfeited in favor of your managers. So to all the FAs of Alexandrite branch, do not sign this document. Do not resign when you don't hit the quota. You deserve all the commission from the sales that you made, not your managers.

✅If you really need life insurance, get a term insurance which is very cheap, and invest the bulk of your money in other investment vehicles like Pag-ibig MP2, REITs, or PERA. All of these can be automated for convenience. This way, you'll be saving A LOT of money.",1198,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1kgy5n6/revelations_as_a_former_financial_advisor/,413
1gfy31y,"Discovered a market disrupting business, realized I'm not a businessman.","My name isn’t important, and this is a throwaway account for security and privacy reasons. I consider myself an amateur researcher/scientist with a passion for cooking, baking, and inventing stuff. At best, a poet; at worst, an artist. During the pandemic, with nothing better to do at home, I dedicated my energy to my love for ice cream—Filipino Sorbetes, Western Custard Ice Cream, Turkish Kulfi, Sorbets, Soft Serve, Popsicles, Mochi. If it’s ice cream, I’ve made it. Any flavor? No problem. Any dietary restrictions? How about a lactose free, sugar free alternative? Any food you want turned into ice cream? Done. I made bamboo-flavored ice cream—possibly a first here and abroad. Black Charcoal sorbetes? I’m proud to say I’m the first in the Philippines to have made it using lab-tested, food-grade activated charcoal.

During the pandemic, I realized there was a massive market for good commercial ice cream. Not high-end, gourmet, expensive stuff mind you, but ice cream that’s better than the junk that Nestlé and Selecta peddle to the masses. Ever wonder why their ice cream feels slimy, gummy, and bland to eat? That’s because they’re skimping on ingredients and feeding you air and lies. But there is a massive goldmine just waiting to be tapped with dirty ice cream I'm surprised no one has capitalized on yet. Simply because my recipe uses better and cleaner techniques and ingredients to achieve a higher profit margin than competitors.

With that knowledge, I started an ice cream business and found early success. I also managed to develop an entirely new type of Filipino ice cream—one that combines Western technology with Filipino techniques, has a higher profit margin than common ice creams in the market, and offers a better flavor selection. However, I soon realized that I’m not cut out for business. I’m too kind. Too forgiving. I was blindsided by unreliable partners, betrayed by friends who wanted my recipe, and ultimately lost the company I started. And worst of all, I failed to get any major contracts signed. (Please don't berate me on this massive mistake, I already suffered enough).

Back when the popular ice cream vendor in Davao, Mang Danny, was still alive, he was offered 6M for his recipe. He didn’t sell, of course; who would in their right mind? Well, I’m in a rough spot right now. I haven’t made good ice cream in weeks due to the stress of dealing with business partners and their bullshit. And I realized that I just wanted to make ice cream, so that’s right, I’m selling...

If any mods want to delete this post if it breaks the rules, please proceed. But otherwise, I can provide credentials and name the company that I started (Yes, the company is doing great, flourishing even, just not what I had envisioned my ice cream, my baby, to be).

I can also name the congressman who commissioned that bamboo ice cream and provide pics for that event. \*That’s a massive hint right there of who I am. \*\*And the lab tests and certificates of our activated charcoal

So yes, if you’re interested in taking the recipe off my hands, please do. So far, it’s only given me heartbreak. I'd prefer it if I could have my friends and people I consider to be my family back. But I guess money is more important to them than relationships...

The recipe is, as the younger kids say nowadays, simply designed and built different. Meaning, other competitor's ice cream just won't be able to compete as efficiently due to the basic nature of what the recipe is and isn't. What’s more, it’s versatile enough to expand beyond traditional scoops. This could include premium packaged pints, artisan popsicles, or even a high-demand catering line.

I don't like to kick other competitors when they are down, and I think they can still improve, but MyChoice Ice Cream uses bad coconut oil that makes their ice cream horrible. **So to try to summarize a TLDR; I am selling the secret recipe, the techniques, business insights and knowledge, a business plan similar to My Choice's, and my expertise..**

For any more questions, or if you would like to request the detailed business plan, please ask me anything you like in the comments or send a DM. If you think this is a scam, send a DM, and I'll make you an ice cream pint if you're in my area.

It's nearing December and I just need a new life and a break..

1bf251f,"I'd say the Philippines has the highest cost of living in South East Asia after Singapore, yet the lowest standard of living... Why is that?","Cost of living is extremely high, relatively, yet people's income is ridiculously low. Think about it...the cheapest meal you can get in Manila at a back alley, hole in the wall joint is 70 piso (e.g. Tapsilog...a child's fist sized plain white rice with 2 fingers worth of the cheapest meat the vendor could get)...but minimum wage, which the majority of the workforce is on, is 600 a day. 

So a single portion of the cheapest food you could get is 11% of your day's wage. And you don't even get a drink with that! Add a drink and it's now 15%. Add another person...like a dependant and now we're at 30%...! You and your loved one at one nutrition-deprived meal that barley filled you up and %30 of your wage is gone! Absolutely crazy!

Grocery is actually more expensive here than in a lot of developed countries...US...Canada...etc., even produce. For example the laundry detergent like Ariel that you get here for 87 piso for a pack of 6 is actually 51 piso ($0.91) in the US. So it's 70% more expensive here, yet people make 70% less!

Electricity is also more expensive. And then there is rent - an even bigger mind boggle. The rent here is criminally high. That's why Filipino's are destined to always be packed like sardines 10 deep in a coffin of a room wherever you go. ""Bed spacer"" signs everywhere...visuals of bunkbeds through windows, like everyone is living in a prison cell, or never made it out of their childhood bed. That's the norm, when it shouldn't be! Which other South East Asians (or even Asians in general) live that way at this rate??

But wait a min! At least they got beds, and roofs. No other Asian country has more homeless people than the Philippines (except India maybe, but they are literally the most populous country in the world. 1.8 million Indians are homeless. But there are almost 1.5 BILLION Indians...so literally 0.1% of the population. I wonder what the stats of the Philippines wound be.). 

Thailand has much better infrastructure and quality of practically everything...from produce, to housing to healthcare, and yet it is significantly cheaper. Even Singapore that's one of the most expensive places in the world, it's cheaper to eat out there than it is here, and for food that is much better! It's crazy! It's like the Philippines is in a perpetual inflation. Why though?

1i86wap,I keep hearing about people saving for years only for one Hospital Bill to Wipe Out Everything - Why is Healthcare so expensive here,"May kaibigan ako - small-time real estate developer siya. Hindi naman super yaman, pero nakaipon siya ng ilang properties over the years. Pero isang araw, nalaman nilang may cancer ang nanay niya. Stage 4.

Siyempre, wala nang tanong-tanong, todo bigay siya para sa pagpapagamot. Binenta niya lahat ng properties niya-rush sale pa kasi kailangan agad ng pera. Wala nang tawad-tawad, basta makalikom lang para sa chemo, radiation, operasyon, at kung anu-ano pang kailangan. Umabot sa halos 20 million pesos ang bill nila sa ospital. Hindi pa kasama doon yung maintenance meds at home care.

She was confined in the hospital for about 6 months.

Despite everything they spent, his mom didn’t make it. Naiwan siya halos walang-wala. Sabi niya sa akin, “Akala ko prepared na ako sa buhay. Pero yung ipon ko pala, hindi sapat para sa isang sakit lang.”

Ang nakakagalit, hindi naman ito isolated case. Kahit may PhilHealth o HMO ka, kakapusin ka pa rin.

Even with an emergency fund and a huge savings, people can still get wiped out.

I've been hearing the same stories from several people that it makes me really anxious.

Why is healthcare so expensive in the Philippines?

nnqvjk,Sobrang sarap pala mag-ipon!,"Hi! I’m Reddit Thriver! 25 years old. 20k/month. Bpo. College dropout.

My goal is to earn a million (or more) in 5 years so i could migrate to Canada. I am already what you would consider an “ulila”. Lost my parent 10 years ago and i have no other siblings. Only daughter. I’m on my own. One property left where i stay now rent-free, and monetary inheritance were eventually left at zero. Over the years, instead of investing on my future i worked on my mental health. Bought a ton of material possessions to satisfy my emptiness. I honestly didn’t want to live any further. I was just waiting to die because what’s it like to live when you’re all alone? Now i just really want to work on my dream.

My first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/n6gaqz/i_can_do_this_right/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I know this is a long read but i just really wanted to let this out and give you some little progress. Ganito pala pakiramdam na every cut off, naeexcite ka magbudget. One thing that hyped me (apart from the encouragement from various awesome, AWESOME redditors) were spreadsheets! Grabe. It made it 10x even more motivating!!! My fixed biweekly rate is around 9k+ pesos every cutoff (inclusive of the tax, contribution and night diff) - i only get more if may bonuses, double pay or incentives. As you can see my salary isn’t that high, i hopped bpo jobs before to the point where employers would reject me because of my portfolio. I sucked up and changed my career decisions and now i’ve been with my current company for 3 years (again, another achievement i’m also proud of!)

Celebrating my baby steps in this subreddit! Barya lang ‘to sainyo, for sure. But it’s the thriving that gives me that kind of high. It’s like i found a will to live again that’s worth celebrating. Haha. In a month:
- wow natuto akong mag-monitor ng expenses ko, up to the last cent! 😳 this was something i have never pictured myself doing!
- i got me a housemate! hati kami sa lahat ng bills - meralco, water, grocery (laking tipid pag may ka-ambag ka sa budget unlike pag wala!)
- opened an account with Komo! (500/payday muna sayang mataas din interest)
- i got monetary gifts from relatives from my 25th bday and i opened a passbook savings acc with Metrobank (no atm) and part of it, i immediately saved to my EF. my short term goal is to finish off at 60k-100k by dec2020! let’s start with that
- 50 pesos on GInvest/payday, i’m now on my 2nd streak (yung 3 local funds pa lang hehe) - i plan to do this long term too, will put more once i increase my income.
- since wala pa akong mahanap na part time in the morning (VA..etc) - i took 4hrs/ot for 2 weeks with my current job. taking advantage of the on top 300/hr. 12 hrs of work per day but, hey! napakalaking bagay — that’s almost 10k din. if tuloy tuloy ang need for OT, i will definitely volunteer again! 
- i also volunteered for some admin work (month end) for a day in the office. 2k on top of the paid day. again, NAPAKALAKING bagay. dati ang 2k sa akin, pang-eat out or shopping na. now, wow it’s a different kind of appreciation!
- i made a col account! and still doing some diligent research about the stock market [and crypto also!]. once done with my ef, and i’m emotionally and mentally ready, saka ako sasabak
- then the regular CIMB EF: 10k 💪, MP2 - 6k, Komo - 1k, Metrobank: 10k [on my prev post, zero and 1k lang sila. But in a month i have already saved 27k! 😍 - and more once i get my ot incentive by next month. It’s the little kilig i get that i did it!]


3% progress! One step at a time!


TLDR; At 25, i constantly contemplate on my past money mistakes. 7 years working, not a single peso in my bank account, zero investments until last month! Nagbago ang ihip ng hangin. I realized there’s no point in regretting the past kasi it’s all gone. It doesn’t matter kasi what’s done is done, what’s important is what i know now. I know better, and still thrive to learn more as i go, i start, save, work smart, be consistent and carry on. Kaya shocks, sobrang thank you! Had i not bumped into this subreddit, mananatili akong mangmang with my finances. Indeed educating myself thru this sub was the way! Thank you r/phinvest and redditors!! This is just a portion of my progress. I plan to post here again, once I achieve my first milestone: accomplished EF!!

1k2p013,5 digit-salary earner but has investments. Yes we exist in this sub,"Madalas ka makakabasa ng mga redditors na earning 6 digits a month with so many assets. Para sa average wage earner, nakakainspire siya at the same time nakakapanlumo. 

Kung isa ka dun, di ka nag-iisa. I'm one of those na 5 digit earners. Hindi sobrang taas pero may natitira din. I have investments pero maliit lang. For benchmark, nasa 6k pesos ang annual dividend earnings ko. Medyo mababa pero that's okay. I'm currently buying stocks pag pumapasok yung mga dividends sa account ko para unti unting mapataas ang earnings. 

I currently have no hope na mag-earn ng 6 digits with my job kasi okay na ko sa current position ko. It gives me a good enough salary for my needs at the same time enough free time para di mabaliw at para magawa lahat ng hobbies ko. I have no dependents and no plans of having a child. 

Some will say na I should hustle since bata pa ko pero preferred ko talaga ang slow life. Factor na din when my friend died so young. Napaisip ako, full speed nga ako sa pagkita, what if madeads ako bigla? I will have so many regrets.

So what I do is balance self love with financial stability. Because not worrying about money is a form of self love. Mas maliit man ang nalalagay mo sa investments, at least meron. Makakagastos ka ng bukal sa loob mo dahil habang nagsasaya ka, kumikita ka pa rin, di nga lang ganun kalaki.

1aoxz61,Sharing how I gained my passive income while still working on my dead end office job,"Recently napansin ko maraming nag tatanong about starting a bussiness while still working at their full time job. I would like to share my experience kasi baka makatulong sa iba or mabigyan kayo ng idea.

I currently work full time sa office and make around 40k a month. I don't spend on things that I don't need and rarely eat out. I still go out once a month and still buy things that I want from time to time but the majority of my money is saved or invested. Now I have 2 other sources of income that give me around 400k a year passively with little to no effort. Here's what I did these past 4 years.

1.I paid all my debt on my first year of work. It doesn't matter if di masarap ang pagkain or walang bagong damit as long as zero debt by the end of the year

2.I listed all my expenses for the month and identified the biggest expense and tried to reduce it. I also stopped spending on things I didnt need. Rarely used subscriptions will make you bleed money. I stopped drinking coffee outside kasi I realized na I was spending 500 a week on stupidly expensive coffee.

3.I saved 80% of my net income (after expenses) for a year habang nag aaral ako kung saan ko pwede ilagay yung pera ko. base sa previous blunders ko, investments made in haste always go to waste (4 years ago I wasted my 100k life savings on a get rich quick investmet, never again), aral muna bago invest.

4.I invested money on stock na may dividends at nagset ako ng monthly investment plan. yung second year ko sa work, I followed my monthly investment plan and was able to get around 50k in dividends. when the stock market fell down during covid (2020) at nung russian invasion of Ukraine (2022) I went all in sa mga stocks na gusto ko kasi based sa assesment ko tataas uli yung mga yun. I was correct. I saved all my earning there.

5.I asked my family members and friends na walang work to help find people na pwedeng mag alaga ng live stock. After 6 or more months ng paghahanap, we were able to find trustworthy people na mag aalaga ng baboy at baka. We split the earnings in half with the caretakers. My family and friends would manage it for me for 10% of my net income tapos all I had to do was check on them once a month. I get around 20-35% net income from these bussinesses per sale depende sa live weight price.

After 4 years of saving and investing di parin ako nag quit sa dead end work ko pero now I don't stress out sa work. I don't grind anymore and I just do what is asked of me. I don't work for a promotion anymore and just take it slow everyday pero weirdly enough na promote ako last year so salamat parin I guess. The money I earn isn't big pero the peace of mind it gives is really wonderful. I don't render overtime anymore sa work and just go home at 5pm para mag laro sa PC ko or mag gym. I hope you guys pickup something from this. Have fun investing and good luck!",1058,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1aoxz61/sharing_how_i_gained_my_passive_income_while/,111
1ey7vjy,Applied for a potato corner franchise,"During interview, they were asking each other bakit daw wala pa potato corner dun since madami nga tao dun sa site na gusto ko.

So madami talagang tao. 

Then kinabukasan nagemail sakin. Disapproved yung site. It’s inside a grocery store. Madami din stalls inside. With average sales of 8k per day yung mga unknown brands competitors. Sabi nila mas maganda daw kasi outside. Their exact words are “this is disapproved as the best location is outside *name of the grocery store*. Mind you, outside of the store cannot be rented. Idk. Feels off lang. Meaning ba nun porket may mas magandang lugar ( na di pwedeng irent), disapproved na yung location inside na maganda din naman? I feel like theyre just gonna use the location on their own instead of letting a franchisee have it. Idk. Weird reason.

1erzfpd,Badly need advice. ₱1.3M debt,"Hello, 24F breadwinner here. Inconsistent monthly income but does not go lower than ₱60k, nasa healthcare field.

I just found out that my parents are in debt halos ₱1.3M and I don’t know where and how to start paying up for this. Breakdown:

Coop - ~₱400k
Credit card 1 - ₱340k (closed na, naka5-year term to pay balance)
CC 2 - ₱150k (active)
CC 3 - ₱130k (active)
CC 4 - ₱260k (closed, 54 months left to settle balance)


Combined take home income ng parents ko nasa ₱17k lang ata. Sobrang baba. Naooverwhelm ako. Panganay ako and magcocollege pa kapatid ko soon. Wala pa akong any form of insurance or investment, but saved up ₱150k emergency fund na.

No judgement please. Our financial situation alone is already taking a toll on my mental health. My parents made bad financial decisions and di naman ako nagkulang iparealize yun sa kanila.

Any advice po on how we can recover? I’m planning to get a loan (I’m pre-qualified for a ₱140k bank loan with 1.5% interest) kasi nasasayangan talaga ako sa interest so gusto ko na magbayad ng isahan. Would greatly appreciate if you can give advice. TYIA.

m6ysrq,Sharing my personal experiences as a typical 30-yo middle class,"Many people who knew me would say that I am a convenient and quite the ""realist"" type, who always chooses what works best in every situation, regardless of what his heart tells him to do.

I am pretty new in the sub, mostly commenting here and there, but I never drafted my post. Lately, however, I have noticed a HUGE DIVIDE going on between people sharing their stories. People who graduated from top academic institutions versus those who came from ""universities, not on the list"" type, those working in high-paying jobs versus those who are working odd-jobs to get by, those who send their siblings to school versus someone who spends their money primarily for food deliveries, and those who feel stuck in their low-paying jobs versus those who have every opportunity within their reach.

So I hope that sharing my experience would help bridge that gap by a little. Before we delve into the discussion, let me share a bit about myself. I am a 30-year old male who graduated from a private university in Mindanao, and a nurse. Still, I never practiced my profession, was a corporate employee (BPO and financial industries) for seven years, and now four years as a self-employed/freelancer. I have five siblings (I am the youngest), and my parents are both in their 60s. So let's start with my personal experiences:

1. Income: When I graduated ten years ago, I remember getting this as my first compensation package: 15k basic salary, 1.5k meal, and clothing allowance, 30 days PTO (like VL and SL combined), plus 500 rice allowance upon regularization. We were still paying income taxes at that time, so my net was around 6.5k every two weeks. Not much, but livable and A LOT better than working as a nurse volunteer. How was it? Not happy, but not miserable either. I used to work in a BPO office near at Mall of Asia, so I needed to rent somewhere in Paranaque. I remember not being able to afford the things I always wanted to have: nice leather shoes, a backpack that would maybe last me longer than a year or two, fiction books which I always read for free in Nat'l bookstore while standing, eat in a Japanese resto, etc. We were taking calls each day, and I remember going to the office one Christmas eve to get that much-coveted holiday OT premium on my paystub. How did I manage my money? I don't recall falling short of it, but I remember NOT SPENDING too much on discretionary items. When most people on their first jobs got themselves some electronic stuff or brought their SO's to an expensive date, I was still using the same bath towel, hankies, leather shoes, inside shirts, even undies, which were either a hand-me-down from my older brother back in college or those I had since high school. I also gave my parents around 2-3k per month for their household bills and helped my sister out in college (she took a 5-yr course, so I graduated a bit earlier). After less than a year, I jumped to several companies and, luckily, landed on a collection role that gave me the most significant boost in my earnings. Yes, totoo po iyong dati na tax namin ang sahod ng iba sa isang buwan, especially if you're a high-performing employee. I remember getting taxed around P15k when I earned a $1,000 commission, and I didn't know what to do at that time. Luckily, I already got a solid frugal mindset, so I could stash it away in a regular savings account instead of spending it. Over the years, I barely improved my salary (the highest I got was 25k basic plus a few thousand for allowances). So I decided to try freelancing/self-employment to control things, especially taxes.
2. Education: I spent most of my childhood years in a public school. To those who never experienced studying there, ganito siya: there are about 50 or 60 of you in a classroom that was supposed to house 20 students max, if you are late, you get to use rickety chairs that could break any minute, fetching water somewhere else because the restroom doesn't have a working faucet or running water, padlocked laboratories whole year, so nobody is stealing or breaking anything, and a single textbook shared by 5-10 students. I would be a hypocrite if I said I enjoyed those times. Pero kahit ganun, I persevered and got a government scholarship (no connections, I went to a testing site and brought it based on the results) that helped me get into the university with the course I always wanted. It was a massive adjustment for me in my first year, especially with P40 as my allowance. Everyone can buy sodas and Snickers anytime. Queuing in the finance office during finals for any unpaid fees (my stipend is just that of a fixed amount), I also had to deal with professors who require students to buy this and that (books, NSTP shirt, earphones for speech class, etc.), or spend close to P50 pesos worth of handouts, etc. But alas, I graduated and passed the board. I was optimistic that I could finally enter med school, but my older siblings declined to support me. Instead, they asked me to take over sending money to my parents. I yielded to their request with a heavy heart and decided to work in the BPO industry and never looked back.
3. Career: Nothing much to share. I started as a call center agent and never got promoted. Lol! I tried applying in several posts before: team leader, SME, trainer, QA, even a lateral transfer to a different department, but all of these were unsuccessful. Was I hurt? Yes. These positions I applied for included tasks I've been doing for months as a ""trainee"" on top of my current responsibilities. So technically, I am just trying to get the paperwork or title, but it never happened. A few years later, I left BPO and switched to banking. Here, I got a supervisory position and was handling sales/marketing. You might say, ""Oh, I thought you were never promoted?"". Nah, if you take branch selling, you will be required to regularly do client visits, which involves late or weekend meetings. Some companies give you a supervisory role to save themselves from paying you overtime, so I was more like an individual contributor, nothing else. After quitting, I tried going back to the BPO industry, but it didn't last longer than three months. I sought advice from one of my flatmates, and he encouraged me to try remote work, so I started looking for one in Upwork. I got a  full-time job from an exciting start-up company in Sydney and added a part-time California-based client (\~20 hours/week with a 20% higher hourly rate) a couple of weeks later. Several Filipino employees were in the former, so I thought it was safe to talk about some stuff there. I had a colleague at that time with whom I shared my arrangement, and she asked me how I was able to ""easily"" get an additional client. I told her that I had already created a portfolio and uploaded it in Upwork. A few days later, the Sydney-based employer had us sign a confidentiality agreement which I didn't mind since almost every company requires it. I was surprised that my employer removed my login and access codes the following day. My Upwork profile was forcibly set in private (making you invisible if a prospective client searches for a contractor) also by Upwork. I talked to my Filipino supervisor over the phone about it and ayun, told me that I violated the confidentiality agreement daw which is a terminable offense. I got devastated kasi; first, they backdated the implementation of the agreement, second, there was no due process, and lastly, betrayed by someone whom I thought was a friend. Good thing I already got a job offer from a supposedly third client (\~25 hours/week with 38% higher hourly rate) at that time, so it wasn't too much of a loss. Fast forward two years after, I quit the third one while the California-based client hired me full-time with a 120% bump in my hourly pay plus some benefits. What's more satisfying is that he referred me to his brother, so I get to work for him too. Now you want to ask me, ""Am I happy with my jobs?"" Sa totoo lang, not really. It pays the bills, but I feel destined for something greater than this. If there is one thing I can be proud of, it is SELF-DISCIPLINE. I still make sure that I meet expectations at work and do not short-change my clients with the required output. Looking for greener pastures is definitely on my radar, but as a middle class, I need to be extra calculating since we're still in a middle of an economic crisis.
4. Insurance: I got my first insurance policy when I was only 20 y.o. It was a traditional retirement product from Manulife. I don't know what pushed me to avail it, probably because I saw the lack of preparedness from my parents and how it presently weighs down upon us. In 2014, I got a Sun Maxilink (a VUL) product but decided to cancel it two years later as I couldn't keep up with the payments (I think I lost around 20k due to fees the uncertainty brought by the elections). In 2017,  I added a term cover for critical illness, knowing that I now have no more employer-sponsored insurance as a remote contractor. Currently, I am paying P35k each year for all three policies.
5. Investments: When I got my final pay from my last corporate job in 2017, I decided to open a UITF product, specifically SB High Dividend Equity Fund. It's still down 40% now, and I feel it would take a very long time to recover.

The things making it an uphill battle.

1. Low and unequal wage distribution. I don't need to talk about why people in Metro Manila get paid higher than someone who lives in Cavite or Davao or why someone working in BGC is paid more than someone who does the same in Cebu. When I started working a decade ago, the entry-level salary for most BPO companies was roughly 12-25k per mo, and it hasn't gone up ever since. Stagnant wages are the biggest enemy of the middle class since most of us rely on our salaries.
2. High taxes. Looking back, it makes me feel sick how the 20-year-old me paid around P1.5k/mo in income taxes from his P15k salary, and it never got better until I switched to self-employment.
3. Inadequate social benefits. Getting good healthcare services requires that you have some private insurance or employer-sponsored HMO. If you are out of work, the best scenario is getting an unemployment benefit on average of P11,000 in TWO months. Our max SSS pension is currently around P17k, which can barely pay for all necessities. P2,400/mo disability benefit. Sickness benefit does not pay even the total amount of your daily wage. To compensate, we need to buy our financial products or look for companies willing to pay for them, primarily after-tax or out of pocket.
4. Outrageously high property prices. Don't get me wrong, I never desired to live in a bungalow mansion, but who doesn't want to have his place, right? Pero wow, 25M for a studio or 1BR condo in BGC, around 15M in Makati,  and 10M in Alabang! A decent one in a secure neighborhood would cost you 20-25k/mo minimum for rent. Some people might argue eh di mag bed space or apartment. Oh right, those underdeveloped areas near them where you can get mugged late at night or bitten by a cockroach while sleeping. I wish it is that easy. Working from home helped improve my finances as I am now location-independent, but I still find it disheartening that entire villages surround our business districts.
5. Inefficient and unresponsive government: If you still need an explanation on this one, I seriously think you live in a bubble.
6. Toxic work culture. I always wonder why crab mentality is so ingrained in our system. Generally, I find working with Europeans, Jews, Aussies, Americans, Russians, and even Indians easier and with lesser dramas. Also, I noticed that we are non-confrontational, but we take things personally underneath. So instead of working together, our emotions get the best of us which plummets our productivity. I don't know, I may be biased due to my limited corporate experience, but it sure makes things more complicated than it already is.",996,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/m6ysrq/sharing_my_personal_experiences_as_a_typical_30yo/,127
158elcv,Scammed by a fake seller and the payment was through GCash - Solved,"Hi!

In this post, I will be sharing my experience being scammed or swindled in a transaction from someone I connected with online with GCash as payment channel.

June 2023: I was browsing through Facebook Marketplace for second-hand DSLR camera sets and found a listing by a “Jayson Lambino” (at the time of writing this post, I am very aware that the person behind this listing might not be the real “Jayson Lambino”, but I will be posting the name as this might be helpful) who was selling his used Nikon D3500 for PHP 13,000. I initiated the conversation through the FB Marketplace messaging system. I know I was stupid not doing this: I did not check out the FB profile of the “Jayson Lambino” that posted this Marketplace listing. I tried to arrange a meet-up to complete the purchase. He said he lives in Antipolo and can’t do a meet up far from his place because he is “taking care of his baby” (I suggested a meet-up in Robinsons Antipolo). Since I reside in Fairview, I thought of having the item sent to my place instead and send the payment through GCash.

June 20, 2023: We agreed to have the item sent on this day. I offered to book a GrabExpress and asked him for his details. Unfortunately, after many attempts, no available riders seem to be near his place (pick up point: Mahogany St. San Luis Antipolo (he said he resides in Antipolo Hills but will just walk to Mahogany St. where pick up would be easier)). He then offered to have the service booked from his end instead through Lalamove (I don’t have Lalamove and never tried using it) and I agreed. He was sending me screenshots of the booking updates until a rider accepted and was heading to the pick-up point. He then messaged me that the rider has arrived and he was making sure that the item is secure. I was asking him to send the tracking link. At this point he was telling that reception is poor where he was at. He sent a GCash account (which was not in his name, but to a Mae June A., claiming it was her wife’s account) saying that I should send the payment before he will let the rider go. I sent a partial (but huge lol) payment of 12,000 saying that I will send the remaining 1,000 after he sends the tracking link. A few minutes after sending the receipt of the transaction, the listing got deleted and I can’t send messages anymore. I searched for the name in Facebook but the exact account wasn’t showing up, but I saw a similarly named account using a different profile image and was from Antipolo. I clicked this profile and lo and behold, there was a pinned public post warning and saying that someone is using his name, pictures, pictures of his ID who is scamming people by fake selling a DSLR camera set. I realized I was indeed scammed so I searched online what I can do and found out that swindling can be reported in GCash (transaction was from my GCash account to the swindler’s GCash account, this is good news). I proceeded and a Gcash rep suspended the swindler’s GCash account after about an hour of me sending the ticket. They asked me to submit a police report of the incident within 72 hours. I searched for similar experiences (in Reddit, blogs, FB posts) and found a helpful blog post online narrating his experience of being swindled by a fake seller, submitting a ticket to GCash, and going to Camp Tomas Caringal (QC District Anti-cybercrime Team) to report the incident. I reside within QC and decided to go to the same office to report the incident I experienced.

June 21, 2023: I went to Camp Tomas Caringal - QCDACT (near Maginhawa) to submit a police report and mentioned that this was a requirement by GCash. Took a photo of the BLOTTER EXCERPT and sent it to GCash (as an email reply). A GCash rep acknowledged the document.

July 19, 2023: I received an update from GCash advising me to send a notarized Narrative Report and Request Letter and a notarized Quitclaim (they provided the templates as pdf files), selfies holding those documents, and a photo of a government valid ID within 72 hours.

July 20, 2023: I sent all the accomplished requirements requested yesterday.

July 24, 2023: The PHP 12,000 amount reflected in my GCash account (the account I used to send the payment to the swindler’s GCash account) and is reflecting in my Transactions as “ADJUSTMENT”. GCash alerted me thru SMS and email with the progress. Ticket is now tagged as “Handled”.

The blog post I referred to as a guide never mentioned that he was able to retrieve the swindled amount (or part of it) and I wasn’t able to find any posts narrating their experience and actually being able to get back the swindled amount so here I am posting mine to let you guys know that it is possible.

The swindled amount can only be retrieved if the amount was still in the swindler’s GCash account at the time the CGash rep processes your ticket (in my experience, GCash rep sent a response that the swindler’s account has been temporarily suspended and all of the recoverable amount is still in the account about an hour after submitting the ticket).",986,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/158elcv/scammed_by_a_fake_seller_and_the_payment_was/,99

1d84qaz,Launched a Salon at the end of January. This month we hit 400K in revenue.,"Wanted to share our my journey of investing into a brand new salon and how we grew it to 400k in revenue in 4 months.

  
Sharing so others can throw in their ideas or learn something from our journey. I truly believe that 2 heads (well thousands in this case) are better than one, so share what's on your mind. The good, the bad, the ugly.



  
**My background:**  
I've been a freelance digital strategist/media buyer for a few years now, primarily in eCommerce and have been fortunate enough to work with some of the largest advertisers on Meta, TikTok, Snap and Google. My bread and butter is digital strategy but a big part of it is creative strategy as well.



**Preface:**

So in October 2023 a family member finally let me advertise their Salon since it looked like they weren't going to be able to cover their business expenses that month. The salon already had a very good reputation for their work and already had an established customer base however, they had no marketing other than sending their customers DMs on FB reminding them to come over for a hair treatment.

 I launched some really basic facebook ads using common direct response practices, thing before and after shots, videos, basic ""tiktok"" style videos etc.

  
It took a couple of days to optimize but by the end of the 2nd week after launch all bills were covered and they even had a little left for themselves. Ever since then I've been doing the bare minimum managing their ad campaigns.

  
The year ended quite well for them with them peaking at 500k in sales in December. In November they asked me and my GF if we wanted to invest into a 2nd branch in the neighboring city and after talking things over, we agreed.



**Month 1 - January/February**

It took us about 3 weeks to find a location, renovate, buy equipment and train 1 helper. We were able to keep everything fairly cheap and invested a total of 200K into the salon, this included everything we needed, even the chemicals used.

I was made responsible for everything digital so that included setting up a brand new page, planning all posts for the next 60 days(I just copied everything from their 1st salon and re-uploaded onto the new page), run some ads to hype up the salon etc. Overall, nothing too interesting here since it's all basically the most common things you'd want to do when setting up a new business.

Leading up the grand opening, I started running the same ads that we ran in the 1st salon just with different text. I did put a lot more focus to refine some details to make them even more direct response by changing colors, fonts, more click-baity text etc.

The 1st month was pretty stressful for everyone since we knew our fixed expenses were about 70k every month and we were really pushing hard to cover them. Everything was new, we had new people that had to be trained while doing the work etc. Finding a workflow that was efficient took us about 3 weeks, we just sucked at it lol. It got so bad I even forgot to pay an outstanding electric bill so we had 1 day where we couldn't take on new customers.

  
Overall the 1st month ended pretty well.

Sales - 184K

Expenses - 133K

Net - \~51K

  
Besides rent, salaries etc, Meta ads ended up costing us about 26K that month which is still pretty good.

Since every business is basically in the Lifetime Value game, we also took down every person's name and phone number that came to our salon. We haven't done it yet but we're planning to reach out to them every 3 months to remind them to get a hair treatment.

  
Every expense and customer is encoded in a google sheet and it's been our bible in providing us the exact numbers of the business.

  
**Month 2 & 3 - March & April**

So with month 2 and 3, not much changes except we were finally getting more walk-ins from people who would pass by the salon or people who saw our ads and just  decided to pop in. Meta ads still contributed to the largest sales driver.

I'm a little disappointed in myself to not push harder in April eventhough the numbers justified it. Remember when I said we track everything from customer name, revenue, services they availed etc? I figured out our conversion rates from meta ads, how much each customer cost us to come into the salon, how much our average cost was in labor, overhead and materials etc. 

  
Week over week I saw conversion rate maintain between 5% to 7%. No matter if I increased the budget slightly or decreased it. We also focused heavily on picturing and videoing all of our work. Its all used for our social media accounts plus most of them are used for our ads to stay on top of creative diversity and creative learning. Right now we've testing close to 70 creatives ranging from statics, videos, GIFs etc.

So how did we end the months?

March Sales - 204K

March Expenses - 133K

March Net - 70K  


April Sales - 212k

April Expenses - 157K

April net - 54K

  
April we had a few more expenses as we had to replace our AC and other things coming up.



**Month 4 - May**



May Sales - 406k

May Expenses - 253K

May Net - 153K

  
So what happened in May? I believed my numbers lol

I doubled down on ads, we ended up spending 2k a day with conversion rate maintaining at about 7%. Turns out scaling from 200k to 400k in sales wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. Yes there are other challenges such as not having enough space, needing to hire someone just to respond to your inquiries, morale being slightly down since it's a lot more work etc but it's sort of a poof of concept to trust the numbers.



Where to go from now? I'd like to keep the ad budget the same but this month give remarketing a try and increase sales without spending much more. We have over  450 phone numbers at this point, so we will start reaching out to them to remind them to get follow up hair treatments etc.

  
I just realized that this is a long ass post and I hope you didn't get too bored. Sorry for my spelling mistakes in advance lol.

  
Also, feel free to ask questions, I love feedback both good and bad.

1664f0y,Grabe yung Shopee SLoan. Talagang babaunin ka sa utang.,"I just received my paycheck and was about to pay my SPayLater dues when a red button below caught my eye:

SLoan: “Get up to ₱50,000 and 100% Disc. Voucher”

So I got curious and clicked. Ang nakalagay:

Cash Loans up to  
#₱100,000  
Activate Now

Then sa ilalim may nakalagay na “Loan Simulation” so ayun ang pinindot ko. Now here’s the sad part. Ito ang payment terms ng ₱100,000 na ilo-loan mo if ever:

3mos - ₱38283.33  
6mos - ₱21616.67  
12mos - ₱13283.33

I did the math and realized that the interest is a whopping 15%/30%/60% respectively. 

Just to clarify, I didn’t apply for the loan. I was simply curious. Posted this for those who were also curious. I remember reading a comment from here asking about this particular loan’s interests. 

More importantly, I posted this for the people who are in desperate need of money. Hopefully mag research muna sila. Kung may bills ka at nababaon ka na sa utang at kailangan mo ng pambayad, PARA SAYO TO.  Whatever happens, please **DO NOT** take this loan or you’ll regret digging your own grave soon after. Please look for other ways rather than depending on online loans or lending apps.",948,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1664f0y/grabe_yung_shopee_sloan_talagang_babaunin_ka_sa/,222
1ictdxm,"Mag-ingat sa Villar Investments: Stocks, Condos, Subdivisions - Lahat May Bayad, Pero Sila Lang ang Kumikita!","Alam mo yung kasabihan na ""Mahirap maging mahirap?"" Mali. Mas mahirap maging stockholder, homeowner, supplier, empleyado, o lupang naagaw sa Villar empire. Kasi dito, kahit saan ka lumingon, may paraan para kang malugi.


I used to buy stocks related to Villar but never again.


I've talked to friends, colleagues, bankers, vendors, and employees of Villar-owned companies, and haven't heard a single positive thing about them.


- Walang Bayad ang Suppliers 


May kakilala akong nag-supply sa AllDay at Coffee Project. Akala niya magandang negosyo. Akala niya malaking kumpanya, maayos magbayad. Limang taon na, hindi pa rin bayad. Kahit demand letter, wala silang pake. Parang libre nilang ginagamit ang produkto mo habang ikaw, bahala kang masira ang negosyo mo.


- Walang Tubig ang Homeowners 


Kung nasa isang Villar subdivision ka at hawak kayo ng Primewater, hindi mo na kailangang mag-abala magbukas ng gripo. Wala namang lalabas.


May tubig? Wala. May bill? Laging meron. May reklamo? Wag ka nang umasa. 


Kung may dumating mang tubig, mabilisan, tapos ubos agad. Pero ang singil? Tuloy-tuloy, minsan abot ng libo kahit hindi mo nagamit. Lahat ng kapitbahay nagsisisi na bumili sakanila (lalo na mga OFWs).


- Walang Kwenta ang Stocks 


Villar IPO playbook:


Hype sa media Pump ang presyo Iwan ang retail investors na bagsak ang hawak 


Kung naipit ka sa AllDay, VistaREIT, Vistamalls, o Medilines IPO, alam mo na ang sakit ng bumagsak na stock. Akala mo blue-chip, yun pala basura stock. Habang ikaw, nag-aabang bumalik ang presyo, sila - nakalabas na at panalo na.


- Walang Refund, Walang Turnover
 

May tropa akong bumili ng Vista Residences condo sa Mindanao. Delayed nang ilang taon, walang refund.


Sa Cavite naman, may forced turnover-walang tubig, walang kuryente, WALANG SUSI. Parang pre-order ng bahay, pero scam. Hindi mo alam kung actual unit mo yung tinurn-over sayo o placeholder lang habang patuloy silang nagbenta.


- Walang Respeto sa Homeowners 


Bumili ka ng bahay sa isang Villar subdivision. Tapos isang araw, nagising ka na lang, ginawang highway extension ang bahay mo. Walang abiso, walang konsultasyon basta giba!


Kung gusto mong magreklamo, good luck. Binayaran mo na, bahala ka na sa buhay mo.


- Walang Kwentang Employer
 

Sabi ng isang dating empleyado sa Villar Group:


Minamadali ang lahat ng proyekto, pero sahod laging late. Toxic work environment, trap sa office politics. Shortcuts sa construction materials, pero premium pricing sa market. 


Kaya pala kada buwan, may hiring. Pero yung sahod? Wala pa rin.


- Walang Takot sa Land Grabbing 


May ilang farmers at landowners na biglang nawalan ng lupa dahil naging parte na ito ng bagong Villar project. Ang dating palayan, naging subdivision. Paano nangyari? Hindi mo na rin malalaman. Ang sigurado, wala ka nang laban.

---

Kung stockholder ka, homeowner, supplier, empleyado, o may lupa na nawala - lahat ng anggulo, may paraan silang gatasan ka.


Kung OFW ka at iniisip mong mag-invest sa Villar IPOs, preferred shares, REITs, condo, o subdivision - isipin mong mabuti. Kasi kung may paraan para maisahan ka, sigurado, covered na nila yan.


Isa na rin ako sa mga nalugi dahil sa Villar-owned company. This serves as a warning.


Update 1: Uunahan ko na yung magsasabi na ""Eh kumita naman ako sa HVN!"" - Oo, maraming nakasabay doon, pero tanong: Dahil ba maganda talaga ang negosyo o dahil lang sa hype? Ginamit lang ang HVN para i-pump ang ibang Villar stocks, pero kita mo naman ang sumunod - bagsak lahat. Kung nakalabas ka sa HVN na may kita, good for you. Pero kung iniisip mong mauulit yun sa ibang Villar IPOs, baka ikaw naman ang maiwan sa taas sa susunod.

Update 2: All Villar owned properties will be very hard to resell in the secondary market because of Primewater. Kung lagi walang tubig, matuturn-off yung buyers. Mahal din sila magcharge for the water, and if malate ka lang ng payment ng 1 day, puputulin agad nila yung water connection niyo, and good luck explaining it to their customer service.

Yung HOA nila, puru Villar appointees. Kung may reklamo kay, tiyak na walang mangyayari. In the end, wala na nagbabayad ng HOA fees kaya wala na rin streetlamps pati security guard.

As for the Internet, Villar's Streamtech lang ang pwede mong gamitin. It's worse than PLDT. And NO, they don't allow any other internet service providers.

Share this to your loved ones to avoid investing in their companies. Maraming OFWs na hindi alam ang shenanigans nila. They keep sponsoring Willie Revillame's shows to target unsuspecting OFWs.

Yung mga may negative experience sa mga Villar-owned companies, please share it here. Let your voices be heard para wala na mabiktimang iba from their unethical business practices. Ilan beses na sila na-complain sa Tulfo, and wala pa ring nangyayari.",945,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1ictdxm/magingat_sa_villar_investments_stocks_condos/,150
1ikj4ww,Filipino Business Nightmares: From Government Red Tape to Vanishing Employees,"Just today, I read a post on phinvest that the FDA increased the price of one of their requirements by 1500%.

Grabe, hirap talaga magnegosyo sa Pilipinas.

Share ko lang din...

A few years ago, I decided to start a business with some family members on the side while working my corporate job. I thought it was a smart move - keep my stable income while slowly building something of my own. At first, it was exciting. I was motivated, full of ideas, and ready to grind.

But reality hit fast.

What I thought would be a simple side hustle turned into a never-ending cycle of stress, unexpected expenses, and employee drama.

Reality hit when I talked to other small business owners, and they all had the exact same struggles.

If you’re thinking of starting a business in the Philippines, maybe you should read this first...

1. The Never-Ending Paperwork and Surprise Fees 

Since I still had my full-time job, I thought registering the business would be easy. Big mistake.

I had to juggle trips to BIR, DTI, Barangay Hall, City Hall, Bureau of Fire, and more each one with its own set of requirements and fees. Some offices said, ""Balik na lang po next week, offline pa system namin."" Next week? Still offline. I finally got all the permits, but surprise! I had to renew them every year - kahit wala pa akong masyadong kita. Miss a deadline? Automatic penalty. Walang patawad. 

One business owner I met said, “In the Philippines, bago ka pa kumita, gobyerno na ang unang kikita.” So true.

2. The Case of the Vanishing Employees 

I hired staff thinking they’d help me grow the business while I focused on my corporate job. Another big mistake.

Some quit after 1-3 months - some leave after getting their first salary or after 13th-month pay. Others didn’t even bother resigning. They just stopped showing up. No text, no explanation, nothing. A few even borrowed money before disappearing. (“Boss, pa-advance lang po...” Next day? Number cannot be reached)

Productivity? Walang nagbago. Minimum wage keeps increasing, but work ethic? Pareho lang... o mas bumaba pa.

I invited 100 people to the interview, 10 lang sumipot, and 1 lang ang qualified. Dun sa isa na yun, magisstay lang sa akin ng 1-3 months and then hanap na ulit bagong trabaho.

I talked to other small business owners, and they all said the same thing: ""Ang hirap maghanap ng matinong empleyado ngayon""

Akala ko ba kulang ang trabaho sa Pilipinas?

3. Copy-Paste Competitors & Price Wars 

After months of struggling, we finally started getting regular customers. Then, suddenly, new businesses popped up - selling the exact same thing.

Some copied our branding, pricing - lahat. Worse, even our suppliers started selling directly to customers at lower prices. It became a price war. We sold at Php150, they sold at Php99, then someone else started selling at Php79. 

A business friend told me: ""Wala nang loyalty sa negosyo. The moment may mas mura, lilipat agad customers mo""

4. The Great Filipino Budget Paradox 

One of the most frustrating things we experienced? Filipino customers expect premium quality - but only want to pay rock-bottom prices.

""Ayoko ng Made in China, gusto ko Japan!""

""Sir/Ma'am, this is Made in Japan, premium quality""

""Ay ang mahal! Wala bang mas mura?"" 

People even compared our prices to Shopee sellers offering free shipping, cashback, and Php1 flash sales. Some would even say, “Pwede discount? Kahit Php10 lang.”

One of my business friends runs a repair shop. Customers always say:
“Boss, ayusin mo na muna, babayaran ko na lang pag okay na... ”Then they never come back.

5. BIR: Everybody Fears the Taxmen

Even though I filed my taxes properly, BIR still found a way to make my life miserable.

One day, I got a notice saying:

""Sir, may tax deficiency po kayo. You owe Php3-5M""

Me: ""Pero less than Php1M lang ang net profit namin!""

BIR: ""Ah ganun po? Pwede naman natin pag-usapan... Php200K na lang, cash na lang ha?"" 

I thought this was just bad luck, but every single business owner I know has a similar story. Some even said BIR does this every few years, like clockwork.

No matter how honest you are with taxes, they will always find a way to tell you that you owe them more.

---

If you can handle red tape, ghosting employees, price-cutting competitors, demanding customers, and extortion disguised as taxes, then sure, go ahead.

But if you think starting a business is an ""escape"" from your corporate job, think again. Running a business is often 10x more stressful than a 9-to-5 job.

After everything I went through, I realized one thing:

1l3tb2u,Planning to avail PruLife? Mag-isip isip ka muna,"Pa rant lang, naiinis na kasi ako. I availed PruLife 10 years exact Protrector, 8 years ago. It was thru my acquaintance, since wala pakong major financial responsibility, kaya I gave it a go and as a support na din sa kanya. I paid it diligently without fail or delay kasi it was automatically deducted from my bank account monthly. I paid minimal to no attention to it but honestly I felt good and proud that I was insured.
Even encouraging my friends to get an insurance as well and lowkey argues with those who are against it.

This year after joining different financial groups and discussions, I realised that there are more negative experiences than the good ones, especially when it comes to claiming the rightful insurance that they paid for. I always give the PruLife the benefit of the doubt for every bad experience or rant I read about them. I always think maybe the policy holder doesn't comply to the rules, or they have missed/delayed payments and so on. 

Finally, I decided to try and visit my online account. Like I said I seldom opens it, maybe twice or thrice in the duration of 8 years and never really explored it. I was kinda disappointed that in the duration of 8 years (I think 96 or 97 months) my account only accumulates around P150,000. I was deeply saddened thinking that the least I could get if I finished the term was 200k, that was the least amount I was expecting because my agent gave me an estimate of 300k - 500k tops, explaining that some portions of my money will be invested in stocks. And to think that I only have 2 more years to complete the term, I felt really disappointed.

Now, I tried to withdraw partially, 100k at first, tutal nakaka-dissapoint naman na yung 150k for 8 years, why not bawasan ko na, and kudos to PruLife I received it within 3-5 days like the email mentioned. Now, my account only got around 50k-60k left, not much but still a significant amount. I decided to fully withdraw my policy. I read the contract, followed the right procedure for my full withdrawal, accomplished the request form,  email it to them along with some IDs and signatures etc. They confirmed the transaction and requested my policy to be sent to them either via email for digital documents or to their customer care center for physical documents. 

So I sent all the requested documents via email days before the deadline, and again they confirmed it. I thought the transaction would be as easy as my first withdrawal, but no, after 55 days of multiple follow ups, receiving the same auto-generated email asking me to  send and resend the SAME documents they requested and received in the first place, they finally declined my transaction. The reason was ""Kindly resubmit  partial withdrawal request with lower amount (PHP 45,000 or below)""

It was not about the left over money in my account, I just kinda feel betrayed and really disappointed. Not to my agent or to those who are sending me the emails. Maybe just to their system in general. To think that they are supposedly good healthcare and financial advocates. 

F! U! PruLife!

x6wmtn,"All the saving, side hustling, and investing just seems useless without any real societal change","Title.

1juv1rn,9M savings in 5 years!,"**Hi everyone! I’m 25 years old and have been freelancing full-time for a year and five months now.** Grateful to share that I’ve been able to save 500K during this time. 🙏

So far, I’ve used part of my savings to buy a good-condition second-hand car (300K) and renovate our family home (around 300–400K). What’s left is 500K, which I currently consider as my emergency fund (around 12 months' worth, with 40K in monthly expenses. Please note that I’m the breadwinner).

I know freelancing can be unpredictable, but I currently have 3 stable clients. If I’m able to keep them until the end of the year, I expect to save 1M–1.3M, as I consistently put aside 80K–100K every month. I also have a source of ""passive"" income which gives me 10-50K  per month depends on how I aggressively promote my products   
  
(but right 98% of my income comes from handling clients since I have been focusing on improving my skills)

Now here’s where I’d really love your advice and insights:

Starting next month, I want to begin investing, maybe 50K–100K into MP2. But a part of me really wants to hit 1M in savings **first** (just for that psychological boost and motivation). I know it might sound petty, but that milestone really means something to me. And my goal for this year is to make money so I can atleast ease myself, as a breadwinner I'm hesitant to take a lot of risks, since next year I'll take more risks so I can make money. I have to have a HUGE back up so I can take risks more.

That said, I also want to be smart with my money. So here's my question:

**Is it reasonable to wait until I save 1M before starting to invest or would it be better to start investing now, even if I haven’t hit that 1M yet?**

Also, looking ahead:

* I want to grow my income to 300K/month next year and save 150K/month consistently
* My long-term goal is to save 9M by age 30
* I plan to start investing more aggressively next year (diversified across different types) (I am still learning all of this, my current marketing client is a multimillionaire and she is a finance coach too. I am very inspired with her and I learn a lot)

And on another note,I’m also an aspiring entrepreneur and currently working in marketing. I *really* want to improve in what I do. Right now, I still feel pretty average, and I want to level up.

So if you have any book recommendations that were game changers for you, **financial or business/marketing-related,** please share them! Or if you follow any really helpful, down-to-earth people in the marketing/entrepreneurship space, I’d be so grateful for your recommendations.

Thanks in advance! I’m very open to learn from everyone here",868,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1juv1rn/9m_savings_in_5_years/,105
wbp2av,Dumating na yung kinakatakot ko,"Hi guys, just a long-time lurker here. I'm sorry kung hindi ito success story on how I increased my income, but rather to vent my frustrations and stress of my current situation. I'm single, that still lives with my parents, but due to circumstances, I'm a breadwinner along with my mom. We only have a combined household salary of less than 50k per month. My mom has an HMO from her company, and I have none since I work freelance. I told myself na kung may magkasakit kahit isa samin, it will ruin us financially. So, it did.

Mom was diagnosed with stage 3 skin cancer last month. Her HMO covered the PET scan amounting to 70k and a minor operation. However, the immunotherapy medicine costs about 140k per session once a month. Where in the hell can I get that kind of money every month?! Naubos na yung EF ko of 40k, I saved that for almost 9 months kasi determined ako na umunlad and I learned saving EF from this sub. It took 2 days to wipe out 9 months of hard work, then hindi pa din enough to cover anything relating to my mom's treatment. I hate it. I hate this life and I don't know why it happened to us.

Now, we are trying all the assistance programs that we get our hands on. From the office of the president to the senators and government agencies. Nagmukha along pulubi to all of my relatives and friends, but I swallowed my dignity just to get through this damn predicament. It's amazing that life hits you in the face, then another punch for good measure. I'm sorry guys, it's not a positive story, but I feel like I have no one to talk to, so forgive me for even writing this.

1gwkpth,Money Lessons I Didn’t See Coming in 2024,"Grabe, 2024 talaga, puno ng life lessons - yung tipong minsan masakit, minsan nakakagising. Napaisip ako kung paano gumastos, mag-ipon, at kumayod nang mas maayos. Natutunan ko rin na minsan, yung simple skills at boring na trabaho, sila pala yung malaking kitaan. Eto mga napulot ko, para hindi mo na pagdaanan.

* **Inflation is Everywhere** (Even in Your Timplado Coffee). It’s not just the grocery bills - 2024 showed me inflation is a sneaky little thief. Yung Andok's Dokito Burger na dati ₱70 lang, aba ₱100 na ngayon! It got so bad, even my favorite fast food “cheat meals” started feeling premium. I had to track everything—from Shopee add-to-cart moments to random late-night snacks - kasi bigla nalang ako nagugulat na paubos na pala ang budget ko for the month.
* **Procrastination is the Real Wallet Killer** \- Ayan, I learned this the hard way. Naalala ko yung sirang aircon namin—akala ko kaya pa, so deadma muna. Two weeks later, it fully gave up... during a heatwave. Napilitang bumili ng bago on the spot sa mahal na. That’s when I realized, yung ""later"" na iniisip mo, mas nagiging expensive now. Whether it’s overdue bills or investments you’re delaying, mas mahal ang epekto in the long run.
* **Learning Skills is the New Emergency Fund** \- 2024 humbled me. I realized savings lang aren’t enough when life hits you hard. Kaya natutunan ko na mag-side gig sa business ng kapatid ko tuwing weekends, para at least may backup ako. A friend of mine learned how to install solar panels para maging freelance installer. It doesn’t have to be complicated, pero having a new skill gives you options - and options are everything when the bills come knocking.
* **Cheap Stuff Ends Up More Expensive** \- Okay, confession: I bought this unknown brand laptop from Shopee kasi gusto ko makatipid. Three months later, sira na. Napilitang bumili ng mas reliable na unit, so doble pa ang nagastos ko. Lesson learned? Not everything na “mura” is worth it. Shoes, gadgets, even home appliances - if you go for quality upfront, you’ll save yourself the headache and surprise gastos.
* **Who You Know is Your Secret Weapon** \-  One casual convo with a friend ended up doubling my income this year. They recommended me for a freelance gig that I didn’t even think I could do! 2024 reminded me na networking isn’t just for big-shot businessmen. It’s about staying open, building connections, and being helpful to people—you never know where it can take you.

**Bonus Tip**

Napansin ko rin na yung mga seemingly ""boring"" professions, malaki pala ang kita. Yung pinsan ko na HVAC technician (yung nag-aayos ng aircon at ref), kumikita ng ₱30,000-₱50,000 sa freelance work para sa mga restaurants. Doon ko lang nalaman na in-demand pala and may shortage tayo ng HVAC technicians. Sometimes, the less glamorous jobs are the ones that pay well.",834,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1gwkpth/money_lessons_i_didnt_see_coming_in_2024/,79
wmge2o,I am now making 99k a month as a 19-year-old! Here's how I did it and here are my next steps.,"First of all, I'd like to thank this sub and everyone who contributes to it. Even being a casual lurker, I picked up a lot of advice and guidance which I attribute to my success now and in the future. 

# How I did it

The general advice for youngsters like myself is to start by investing in ourselves. Investing in things like stocks and real estate wasn't viable for me because like most teens, I didn't have the capital required to make significant returns. So with all the free time in the world and the collective knowledge of the internet at my fingertips, I invested in myself by learning.

>First, you learn. Then you remove the 'L'.

At first, I'd learn about budgeting, investing, finance, trading, cryptocurrencies, and whatnot. These things are useful to learn, but I didn't get anywhere because I couldn't apply them to real life without having a proper cash flow. It dawned on me that I would either have to start a business or get a job.

I tried bitcoin mining with a friend, selling bike parts and upgrades, crypto trading with my savings, and investing in axie, all with returns that were not worth the effort. The only thing that only paid off was my learning about web development.

>Don't half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing.

Amidst all my failed business ventures, I spent more than a year upskilling myself in web development. After all the defeats, I had one more backup plan, which was to try and sell my time and skills instead of selling products or exploiting the markets. 

I focused on web development 100%, learning only through free online resources like [Harvard's CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0), [The Odin Project,](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and youtube. and by the end of this July, I got offered a permanent web development job compensating in USD, and that is where I get the majority of my 99k a month. The rest is from allowances and investments.

# My Next Steps

**Building upon my Emergency Fund.** My first step is to save up 6 months' worth of my income to my EF.

**Increasing my Job Security**. While I'm building my EF, it'll give me time to focus on becoming more valuable to the company and less dispensable. Maybe I can also get a promotion/pay raise during these 6 months.

**Building a side-hustle.** Others might suggest that I first invest in safe vehicles like index funds and whatnot, but I have zero financial obligations and a lot of capital, so it's safe for me to take risks and possibly reap high rewards. I'm thinking a money lending business would be a great fit for me.

**Investing externally.** After I've built a profitable side-hustle, I'll start investing in Stocks, Crypto, and Real Estate. 

**Investing in myself (again).** A man only needs three things in life: Wealth, Health, and Happiness. I've got a little wealth in my hands, so I'll continue working and investing more into the other two.

**Living my life.** I'm not one to splurge on materialistic things anymore. I think I'll spend my free time and money on experiences with friends and families. I'm still in my physical prime, so I think I'll do a lot of traveling.

# In Conclusion

If you already have a laptop and an Internet connection, all you need now is a willingness to learn and the motivation to chase your dreams. Sure, I might have had luck on my side, and I do not deny that. But it shouldn't stop you from trying to shoot your shot. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

I am not smart, nor am I talented; I just had the luck of stumbling upon this sub it took me most of the way here. You can find all the answers on the Internet if you look hard enough.

1ftpxqu,Reality Check: Only 3% of Filipinos Earn Over 100k/month,"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/09/Screenshot_20240927-140301.png

I’m sure many have seen the PSA’s FIES report, which defines income classes and includes percentages of the population falling into each income class. 

Here’s the full report:
https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/income-expenditure/fies

Rappler also released an article referencing the study, headlining that 25k/month gets you to the middle class:
https://www.rappler.com/business/middle-class-philippines-pids-study/

Many people in the main PH sub reacted negatively to this article, expecting that middle-class means a decent life just like what it implies in a first-world setting. But middle class just really means you’re in the middle - 65M Filipinos (60%) live on less than 25k per month, 45M live on more than 25k per month, so that’s pretty middle if you ask me. True median (50th percentile) is about 20k/month.

Now using the data from that table, you can also derive that only 3% of Filipino households earn over 100k per month. Despite what the impression of this sub gives, the reality is that when looking at the bigger picture, “6-digit” earners are a small minority of total PH population. Do note though that 3% is still 3 million people, so it’s still a lot. A few other data points:

- Top 10%: At least 60k/month
- Top 1%: At least 150k/month
- Top 0.3%: At least 240k/month

Full percentile computations:
https://i.imgur.com/WtJtE5K.jpeg

What does this mean? If you think this sub is full of alleged 6-digit earners, remember that they’re only a small minority of the population, and it’s either it’s a noisy minority, or just many LARPers who like to pretend they earn at that level.

That said, it doesn’t change the fact that even at 100k/month, it’s possible that you still won’t feel rich in the Philippines, even if you’re already richer than 97% of the population. After all, even by FIES’ definition, 100k is only upper-middle income. But at the very least, you can be grateful that you have it better than most.
