    "title": "My mom thought her P2M diamond collection would save us someday. When my dad got sick, we found out it was nearly worthless.",
    "body": "For 30 years, my mom built her version of a portfolio: Diamonds.\n\n\nMy mom is a housewife for over 30 years. She used a portion of my dad’s salary to buy rings, earrings, pendants - piece by piece, milestone by milestone. Weddings, anniversaries, birthdays. Over time, the collection grew. According to her, diamonds are \"forever\" and \"magandang investment kasi tumataas ang value.\"\n\n\nIn her mind, those pieces were our emergency fund. Our inheritance. Our fallback.\n\n\nShe estimates she spent around 2M pesos total over the years.\n\n\nShe assumed by now, the value would've doubled to 4-5M pesos.\n\n\nBut when my dad got sick last year, we finally tried to cash in on this so-called \"investment.\"\n\n\nNagulat na lang kami that the pawnshop offered us 35k for the whole collection.\n\n\nJewelry buyers from binondo and bulacan even warned us: \"Mam, this is mostly low-quality and non-certified stones. Hindi to pang-resale.\"\n\n\nShe bough most of her jewelry from door to door jewelers like the good old days.\n\n\nWe tried to post it on Facebook Marketplace and Carousell but just crickets.\n\n\nSome even messaged: \"Mukhang fake to eh.\" Others wanted to lowball to 3k-5k per piece.\n\n\nThis made me do a lot of research and I learned about Lab Grown diamonds. These have entered the market a few years ago and became popular recently. They’re nearly identical to mined diamonds but cost only 1/5th of the price. Thus, diamonds now are nearly worthless. They also didn't issue GIA Certificates back in the day.\n\n\nSome reports say lab-grown diamond prices drop by 10–20% per year.\n\n\nBuyers now are smarter, savvier, and less sentimental. Most who are into diamonds know how to spot value, and they’re not willing to overpay for legacy stones.\n\n\nWe ended up with a beautiful velvet box filled with pieces we can't sell at a good price and can't rely on.\n\n\nMy mom thought she was building a treasure chest. Turns out, it was a financial time capsule filled with false hope.\n\n\nI learned that jewelry is a poor emergency fund. Resale value is a myth unless you have rare, investment-grade, certified stones.\n\n\nGrabe din talaga marketing ng diamonds, sobrang ingrained na sa mind ng most women.\n\nUpdate: Gold is a better investment than diamond because it appreciates pero kelangan yung Gold is as close to the market price per gm as possible. Walang value yung design ng Gold no matter how intricate.\n\nUpdate 2: Thanks to @futonn for this insight:\n\n\"I'm gonna say this as someone who was a manager in a fine jewelry brand where our main selling point was diamonds.\n\nDiamonds have always been worthless. Their value significantly decreases the moment they leave the store, whether they're earth mined or lab grown. Some hold their value better like earth mined or certified stones, but a lot of the value is inflated because of the perception people have over diamonds. We literally have protocol of what to say when clients ask if earth mined diamonds are investments, we never say yes, we only say they hold their value better. This is why the same diamond with the same specs can have such varying prices depending on who sells them.\n\nDiamonds are not good investments, but they're good heirloom pieces because they will truly last forever especially if you care for them. For real material investments just go for real estate or gold.\n\nThat being said, lab grown diamonds can be more expensive (in retail) than earth mined if the specs are better. Earth mined diamonds can be absolutely worthless with substandard specs.\"",

I was in the same boat with my mother's jewelry spending, and we had them appraised and eventually graded (GIA for the good ones, any other available labs for the average ones - IGI, AGS? Etc.).\n\nCan you send set diamonds (set meaning already placed in jewelry) for grading? - No. You have to take them out for grading.\n\nAre loose diamonds more expensive than set jewelry? - No. Set jewelry is more expensive but the market is leaning towards buying loose then having them set to their preferred design. \n\nOur final steps:\n1. Sold the gold (yellow, white, etc.) - look at the global index. A lot of websites available. Sell when the price is right. People will buy at 80% of market value which we bought our gold at way cheaper than today's 4k+/g pricing.\n\n2. Sold the good graded gems for a profit. Consigned some to reputable live sellers, others sold to friends. \n\n3. Sold some of the average gems to jewelers for those that require multiple stones (think eternity rings, tennis bracelets)\n\n4. Re-set some of the gems para may natira padin sa mother ko for sentimental purposes\n\nAfter the process, we sold them and got +10% profit. (Net of transportation and grading costs). This was good considering my mom's knowledge of diamonds was limited to the shine but yellow diamonds (H grade and below) can still shine in the right settings. \n\nOverall learning:\n-Yes, diamonds are still investments\n-Selling jewelry is hard work\n-Research research research\n-Credibility is key for jewelry sales so your knowledge, the grading certificates, etc. Will factor in to the final price. \n\nI suggest you dive more into the trade than pawning it out for easy money. Considering the urgency, you may consider selling the lower pieces. Sayang din yung money invested by your parents. Kaya yan gawan ng paraan with some research and finding the right leads.\n\nI did this with minimal help from my fam. Finished the process in almost a year. Sana kayanin mo din. Good luck!",

Again this is a throwaway account rin po and I just wanted to tell my story. I do encourage you to make other people’s days by awarding their posts instead hehe. Quota na po ata ito hehe.\n\n\nThrowaway because I don't want people to recognize me and I'm too shy and don't want to seem like I'm bragging but felt like I deserve to let it out.\n\nBackstory: My parents are pretty well off. I was 20 and didn't even have a bank account because I was used to always just asking for money whenever I needed it. I never worried about money and thought I'd never have to. I was way too immature and was used to just spending all of my allowance buying food for friends (my weird love language) and since I study in UP, I sometimes also buy food for students who can't afford it from time to time. So even at 20, I just never thought about saving up for anything because:\n\n1. I don't really want anything for myself. I wasn't into clothes, shoes, gadgets, etc. Just food really. And eating at Bonchon was already me \"splurging”. I just never liked spending for myself.\n2. I was used to the idea that my parents will help me with money before I find work.\n3. I really was just immature and sheltered in general.\n\nCringey right?\n\nWell, that all ended when I was abused at home. I mean sure we're used to being \"physically disciplined\" ever since we were kids, but that time... That time was too much for anyone to handle. Let's just say my eyes and lips bled and I was kicked in the head (haha pun but yeah literally I was) and chest way too many times than I could count. Painkillers for a whole month after that. Also didn't help that I'm a girl, below 5 feet and weigh 40kg.\n\nSo with the help of my school and friend, I hid the clothes and things I could carry in a bag wrapped  with trashbag to hide them and ran away in the middle of the night. For a month, the professors and a dorm in UP helped me out. They gave me a place to stay and food to eat. Granted that by the end of it, donations were running out, and some days we don't get much food, so I knew I had to find work soon. I tried and tried but every call center and tutorial interview I took just lead to dead ends.\n\nUntil I found r/slavelabour and r/forhire. It was crazy. It was my first time earning anything. I was amazed and excited because I could finally get a bit more food. My first splurge was a bag of doritos.\n\nI guess I was lucky enough that I'm a natural workaholic. I did everything anyone could ask me to do.\n\n* Need me to photoshop this? Yeah sure u got it!\n* Need me to code this? Yeah absolutely!\n* Do you know how to do this? No, but I can learn!\n\nI worked on myself. I learned all the skills I needed. I wasn't very smart but I sure as hell was stubborn enough to not give up. I survived *that* night, I damn well could survive the rest of my life. From working $2-$5 jobs just so I'd have something to eat each day, to only doing $40 minimum tasks after half a year. I now have a pool of loyal clients who ask me to do odd jobs on a regular basis and give work to schoolmates who need money during the quarantine.\n\nI saved up, invested a part of my savings, and at 21, I just reached 200k and nobody except one friend knows.\n\nI also just landed a pretty good job that pays 50k per month as a remote worker for an international company while I'm a student. I have three jobs, work in 4 different timezones, and try (my best) to balance everything with school and maybe sleep whenever I can (lol).\n\nI'm slightly dying from overwork but for once, I can say that I'm truly proud of myself. And hopefully soon, I can finally be completely free from my abuser/what I went through once I save up enough.\n\nAlso just want to thank Reddit and everyone who was there for me for literally saving my life.\n\ntdlr: My life turned upside down. But I said screw it and did the best I can. I’m an engineering student earning 50k per month now. Things do become better with time!\n\nEdit: I really appreciate everyone who was worried about my health and I’ve been thinking about it the past few weeks too so I’ve decided to let go of one of my jobs as a virtual assistant and am asking my employer if I could train my friend as my replacement. Thank you po for helping me realize that I should take care of myself above everything else Hehe. Lastly, thank you po for all the kind words. You’ve all made my day and inspired me to work harder and be better as a person.\n\nI will also find the time to post rin po about where and how I found work for all those who commented and messaged me! :)\n\nUpdate: I’m sorry I can’t reply to everyone po but I’ll post a detailed post about how to get work po in a couple of days when I have time oo uli. Again, thank you po and good luck po to everyone!",

    "title": "[UPDATE] Hey! I'm that 21 yr old college student who was homeless, had 500php in her pocket, and now have 200kphp in savings after a year. A lot of you asked me how I did it, so here's everything I've learned from the past year. I hope this helps :)",
    "body": "Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/msyfhf/almost\\_exactly\\_a\\_year\\_ago\\_from\\_now\\_i\\_ran\\_away/](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/msyfhf/almost_exactly_a_year_ago_from_now_i_ran_away/)\n\nHi! Since I can't reply to everyone individually and received lots of requests from people especially struggling college students like me, I decided to post everything I've learned and done the past year that lead me to where I am now. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Did you apply for jobs and/or use freelancing sites like Fivrr, Upwork, etc.?**\n\nI tried to find call center and english tutorial job openings through Jobstreet but kept getting rejected since I was still a student. I also tried to use Fivrr for some time but just didn't have any luck with it. I also found their fees on top of paypal fees unfair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nH**ow did you find work?**\n\nIt all really started when I was looking through Reddit for homelessness during Covid how to's (again I was very sheltered and just didn't have any clue). I also went to r/assistance and asked for advice and told them a bit about my story. I was also quite desperate at the time since food donations were running out and the dorm was about to close so I told them that I'm a mediocre artist but if anyone would be willing to let me draw for them for $3 it would really help me out.\n\nSurprisingly, more than 10 people stepped up to help me deal with the emotional trauma and gave me some tips about dealing with homelessness. They asked me to draw for them and refused to pay me unfairly and gave me more than I ever asked for. They also advised me to look through subreddits for paid tasks. This I guess was the start of me applying for Art Commission jobs through Reddit.\n\nThis was probably the most humbling experience I've had in my life because I've always been the person who gives instead of the one who's in need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where did you find work?**\n\nWeirdly enough, just purely Reddit for the past year. Never applied anywhere else. The subreddits that helped me immensely were:\n\n* r/forhire — The most professional and formal subreddit for jobs and tasks. Tasks or jobs here are usually for long term or have a specific durations that range from weeks to months. DO NOT ever offer or ask for low pay here. They highly believe in fair and US standard pay. The mods and community in general are very strict. DO NOT ever comment to apply. Message, chat, or email the OP depending on their preference. You will get banned if you apply in the comments. READ the rules. First time offenses will get you banned, no exceptions.\n* r/DesignJobs — Same as r/forhire except it's focused on Design, Art, Photoshop, etc. If you know how to make logos and etc. there's a lot of jobs here for you regularly. Again, read the rules. First time offenses will get you banned, no exceptions.\n* r/SlaveLabour — Mostly straightforward tasks with significantly less pay hence the name. This is what I mainly used in my first few months freelancing since I didn't have enough experience to have a portfolio or CV yet. But the best thing about this is that you can spend half an hour on a task and get paid quickly. Comment $bid on the post itself but to stand out I would suggest commenting ex. for coding tasks \"$bid I'm a computer science student and can do this for you!\"\n\nThis might not always happen to everyone but like I said in my original post, I have a pool of loyal clients now and they all came from this sub. Since I did well on the first job and gained their trust, they gradually started depending on me for various tasks instead of posting on the sub each time they needed someone. (This is important) A lot of the times they also know that even if I don't know something, they can trust me to learn it quickly and be able to execute the task well so they gave me all the tasks they can possibly think of. Some of them I've had since June and I was able to negotiate my pay from the initial $3-10 rate to $40-50 per task depending on the difficulty and time.\n\n* r/gameDevClassifieds — This was initially just for a passion project since by the time I found this subreddit, I had a decent amount of savings already. This sub is also mostly full of indie game developers so they \"pay\" you in shares instead of upfront. Whether the game will earn anything will entirely depend on the success of the project so this probably won't be good. There are some rare gems from time to time who offer monthly salaries. Among Us devs were actually hiring through this sub a few months ago. Will discuss this part by the end of this post.\n* Other subreddits. I think there's some focused For Hire groups for writers, transcribers, developers, etc. too\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do I make sure I‘ll get hired?**\n\n* ***Be active.***  Kailangan matiyaga ka maglurk. My usual day would be work > refresh reddit feed > work > refresh reddit feed. Why? Because you will have better luck getting the job if you're the first one to apply, especially on r/slavelabour. Also because I wanted to make sure that once I was done with my current task, I would already have something after. So join all the subreddits I've mentioned, Sort by New, and refresh every 2-5 minutes. Or if you're not confident enough for the other subreddits yet, Join r/slavelabour \\&gt; Filter by \"task\" > Sort by New > refresh. Not too sure if there's a more automated way of doing this though.\n* ***Sell yourself.***  This is how the client will know you're worth hiring compared to the others especially for the more professional subreddits. I usually refrain from copy pasting my messages unless it's for Art Commissions and even then I tweak it so it'd fit their needs. Mention one or a couple of things in their post and talk about it and sell your relevant skills. Also provide your name (A simple \"Hello! I'm \\_\\_\\_\\_ etc.\"), your past experiences, link to your portfolio etc. No need for a formal CV unless asked for.\n* ***Build on your portfolio.***  This is a must especially if you're an artist. At first I had a hard time with this because I didn't have much time for art before everything happened so I didn't have much to show them. All I had was my old tumblr blog I used as an art dump. It worked for awhile but I was offered significantly more and better jobs when I had my Portfolio (or CV if needed). Every time I finished a task, I add and update it. *You're building on yourself by building on your portfolio.*\n* ***Every time you see a task. Always ask yourself \"Can I do it?\" and NEVER say no.***  Always answer with a \"Maybe\" but I personally prefer “Probably” just because it encourages me more, proceed to open google and search about the task (tutorials or videos or whatever you can find), and then gauge if you can learn it for the task. But DO NOT spend too much time on this (maximum 3-5 minutes) because if you really can't, you can't. You know yourself better than anyone but always be open to learning new skills. It will help you in the long run. This is probably the most important out of all of them and I wish I realized this earlier. I passed up way too many opportunities just because I thought I was only capable of drawing and a bit of programming. (ex. I never knew VBA in excel especially bec of its relatively confusing syntax, but it was a $50 job and I said screw it, searched, gauged if I can figure out, did a pretty damn good job at it. Another skill acquired and more sources of income!)\n* ***Be willing to learn.***  Like I said, be open to learning new skills because new skill = new source of income. And the more = the better. A good place to start would be to check which tasks are common in your preferred subreddits. Don't know how to it? Learn it. Can't do it? Find the next best task you can learn. Don't stop, you can figure something out.\n* ***Be trustworthy.*** The clients will know and will always come back to you.\n* ***Be kind to yourself.*** Eat your favorite snack or watch your favorite tv show before working, anything that can help you feel great. Trust me you’ll work faster and better.\n* ***Lastly, Believe in You.*** You’re capable of things. Everyone is. You just have to find the right thing for you. You will always grow no matter what so let yourself and actively work on it. Learn things and be things you never thought you could be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* For tasks that might take hours and have certain stages, always ask the client if you could work on the draft first and send it to them, get paid 50%, continue working, and then get paid the rest. If they say no, run. This is a huge red flag and I personally would not go for it.\n* Stalk your client's reddit. If they don't have posts or their account is less than 10 months old, you'll most likely get ghosted after the work. Look for clients with a relatively active and old account.\n* After each task always say something like \"Let me know if you have any more requests/work for me or if you need my help with anything else. :)\" This would help them remember you for future tasks. Make sure to be nice and memorable enough!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What jobs/tasks did you usually take?**\n\n* **Digital Art/UI Designer —**  This, believe it or not, was a bit surprising because I was never really good at it and I was mediocre at best. Before running away, I actually debated with myself if I should bring my drawing tablet but thought of the possibility that it might help me somehow and gladly, it did. The hardest part was that I only ever drew landscapes and most clients wanted portraits of themselves. I had no idea how to draw people, let alone faces. But I did the best I can and worked on my skills, watched videos, searched countless tutorials. I practiced day and night until I got the hang of it.\n\nInitial Pay per artwork (May 2020): $10-$15\n\nMidway: $40-90\n\nNow: $80-300\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Virtual Assistant —** This was actually a very humbling experience given that I'm again, sheltered and always saw myself as the boss (we were weirdly taught to think that way growing up and I was being groomed to take over the family company after college so this felt weird at first). I worked for an American student living in Tokyo lol rich kid problems for $5/hour with a $5 weekly base fee. I usually worked 7 hours per week. This was my source for grocery and food budget. I've been working for him since June 2020 and he's given me a few raises and referred me to other clients. So at the moment I'm handling 3 people from (Him in Tokyo, UK, St. Louis) before I could fully transfer them to my friend since I've just landed a new full time job. Hit a rough patch around January and tried to leave work but he ended up asking me to come work for him again after rejecting more than 10 applicants. Again, be good enough so your employer will gradually also be loyal to you.\n\nInitial Pay (June 2020): $5/hour \\* 7 hours + $5 weekly base fee\n\n= $40 per week (\\~8,000php per month)\n\nMidway to Now:$7/hour \\* 7 hours + $5 weekly base fee\n\n= $54 per week (\\~10,400php per month)\n\n(Now I only work 4 hours per week though since I have other jobs and he adjusted as long as I don't leave raw lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonuses:\n\nActually pretty funny because my client always procrastinates so he decided na every time he doesn't do something on time, he gives me money. Haha I never asked for it and I tell him he doesn't have to but he insists talaga so he feels accountable raw. We've become relatively close na but still professional since I manage his day to day life.\n\nex. \"If I forget to email this thing to you, I'll send you $50\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Coding Tutor** —  This one started as just a programming task to help fix a guy's code for $20. I did it once, got paid, and thought it was done. But oddly enough, he just kept coming back and the pay doubled. This was kind of an intellectual achievement for me because I'm literally tutoring a guy older than me who's studying computer science in a prestigious tech school in the states. (sidenote: It's also healthy to boost your ego sometimes! hehe)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Mobile Dev** —  This one also started as an html email job. Client couldn't fix it and needed it quickly for a deadline. Also did it once, got paid, and thought it was done. And then the guy liked me enough and asked if I could handle Wordpress mobile development for a Top Mortgage company in Canada. I said I've never used Wordpress in my whole life, but I've had some background with html/css/c/c++ and again, I watched tutorials first and gauged if I can learn it while I do it. He said he trusted me and that I could probably figure it out. I winged it and then I did it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Other kinds of tasks ex. quick photoshop edits, fix my word docx format, etc.Ranges from $5-20\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where did you invest your money before you reached 200k in savings?**\n\n* **Shopee.** I opened my own Shopee store for some time and sold through FB Marketplace. I found a supplier for macbook sleeves, had my own mini photoshoot in my dorm, created my own promotional materials, bought special packaging, and sold them for a profit. Reselling things for me aren't ever worth it if you don't make them any different from when you first bought them from a supplier. I was able to sell them each for 450php more. Was selling 3-5 of them per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Crypto.** I was a bit late into it but I got in around January, enjoyed a very short bull run, until it eventually crashed and lost most of my profits because I was a noob. Decided to stop crypto trading for a couple of months, left them all in ETH and BTC, both went up so had a bit of profit. Day traded, which wasn't a super good idea bec a lot of losses but had a bit of profit again. Learned as much as I can, watched videos, tutorials. At one point, I was able to x3 my initial investment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How did you reach 200k in savings?**\n\nLike I said, I did a whole bunch of things. Maybe even too many probably. I'm a workaholic. There were days when I just kept taking in work that I earned $300 in a span of three days working on various tasks. Probably didn't sleep that time too. Don't worry I'll take care of my health better from now on na po hehe! I did stop working for a week after that though to recover lol. But yeah basically everything I've written here!\n\nBut most of the time my regular work each month was minimum 2 art works, regular VA job, 3-5 odd jobs.\n\nAlso don't forget to reward yourself from time to time. I usually buy milktea and food before starting each difficult task to motivate myself! I just think of it as my \"transpo allowance\" so I don't feel too bad HAHA. But it helps me work on tasks faster and better which lets me work on more tasks so ↗ Stonks ↗ parin naman.\n\nAlso risky so I can't recommend this too much but crypto has helped me up my net worth by a significant amount as compared to just keeping them all in my bank account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How did you land that 50kphp/month Job?**\n\nAgain, since I've made it a habit already, I lurked on subreddits and found r/gameDevClassifieds around last January. It was really just for the experience and I never thought I would find anything there. Until I found this really really vague post about this game looking for a digital artist that pays 1000usd/month. Everyone was basically saying it's a scam at that point but me being the curious person I am, decided to reach out. Well... found out that the reason that they were being super vague is because they had to keep certain details in secret in preparation for their pre-alpha release on Steam on March 2021. I took the interview, spent days on the drawing test.... and then got rejected. Yep, rejected. And then I asked for another shot. I mean as a Stardew Valley lover (the game was close to SW + animal crossing), I just had to ask for another shot. And then I passed. But again, no openings for me this time. They said they'll contact me by March. Well, March passed and nothing. Basically crickets. I gave up on it. Regretted the full week I spent on the drawing tests. Was just so disappointed because I knew I would have really loved the job.\n\nUntil the second week of April at around 4am. They contacted me. And now I'm on my second day of working for them. 40 hours per week + acads are quite hard to balance. But I know I'll forever regret it if I pass up the opportunity to contribute to something this awesome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How should I start?**\n\nDon't be afraid to *start small* like I did. It's how you'll get to the top in the long run. Start with the small paying jobs, learn from them, work on yourself, acquire more skills.  *Move on to higher,  and greater things.* Grow as a person, grow your net worth. Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI hope this helped or will help everyone in the future. :)\n\nKakayanin kahit mahirap! Hahanap ng paraan kahit anong mangyari!Good luck po! And thank you again for all the support.Feel free to comment on this thread if you have any other questions hehe.\n\n(Also this is pretty long and no time to proofread hehe so pls excuse my typos)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Since a lot of people have also requested. Here’s a sample message I sent to a vet looking for a Virtual Assistant ([https://imgur.com/a/PQftST9](https://imgur.com/a/PQftST9)). Again like I said, pay attention to the job description.\n\n1. I mentioned my volunteer work for stray animals since she’s a vet\n2. She has ADHD and but high functioning so I also mentioned that I can relate and understand what she’s going through And turned my weakness into a strength.\n3. The job was mostly for emailing clients about scheduling but most especially, to inform them when their pet is sick or has passed away (huhu super sad talaga nito so personal messages are required). So I made sure that I mentioned and showed that that I’m an empathetic person and will know the right words to say to people suffering from loss not because it’s my job, but also because I care.\n\nbtw the first sentence was her requirement so no need for that unless the client specifies it’s needed\n\nUnfortunately, I could no longer take this job since I just got accepted before she was able to have time for an interview.Hope this helps! :)",

    "body": "Quick Backstory...\n\nI'm sharing this because of all the questions I got from my post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1i86wap/i_keep_hearing_about_people_saving_for_years_only/).\n\n\n\nShoutout to u/cessiey for dropping the knowledge bomb about Guarantee Letters (GLs) and how they can save you serious money on hospital bills. Honestly, I had no idea these even existed until then.\n\n\n\nAfter reading their comment, I got curious, so I asked friends, Googled like crazy, and pulled together everything I learned about GLs. Now I’m sharing it here so that if ever you’re dealing with expensive hospital bills or just want to be prepared - you’ll have this as your go-to guide. Save this for future reference, kasi you’ll never know, di ba?\n\n\nWhat Are Guarantee Letters?\n\n\nA GL is like a promise letter from an organization (government agency, LGU, employer, or private group) telling the hospital, “Kami na bahala sa part ng bill niya.” It’s basically a way to get financial assistance without paying everything out of pocket.\n\n\nWho Can Issue Guarantee Letters?\nHere’s a list of the most common sources:\n\n\nPCSO (Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office): Popular for helping patients with chronic illnesses like cancer or those needing dialysis.\n\n\nLGUs (Local Government Units): Your city hall or provincial government often has programs for medical aid. \n\n\nDSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development): Prioritizes indigent families but will consider urgent cases too.\n\n\nEmployers: Some companies offer additional medical coverage or can provide GLs through partnerships with hospitals. Private \n\n\nCharities: Organizations like church groups or Rotary Clubs sometimes issue GLs, especially in emergencies. \n\n\nPoliticians: Senators and other politicians can also provide GLs, sometimes even to non-constituents.  For instance, the Senate Public Assistance Office facilitates medical assistance requests through individual senators' offices. \n\n\nHow to Apply for a Guarantee Letter\n\n\nThe steps vary by agency, but generally, it looks like this:\n\n\nRequest an application form from the agency or group issuing the GL. Submit the required documents, usually including: Hospital bill Medical abstract Valid IDs Wait for approval. Some agencies can process this quickly (same day), while others might take longer. \n\n\nPro Tip: Many agencies now accept online applications. For example, PCSO allows online submissions for hospitals in the National Capital Region. You can download the Medical Assistance Program (MAP) application form from their official website, fill it out, and email it along with the required documents to ncrmap@pcso.gov.ph. \n\n\nContact Information for Government Agencies:\n\n\nPCSO:\n\n\nEmail: ncrmap@pcso.gov.ph\n\nWebsite: www.pcso.gov.ph \n\n\nDSWD:\n\n\nEmail: fo2@dswd.gov.ph\n\nWebsite: www.dswd.gov.ph \n\n\nSenate Public Assistance Office:\n\n\nDownload the SPAO form here, fill it out, and send it with the requirements to the designated email addresses of the concerned Senators. \n\n\nKey Things You Should Know\n\n\nIt’s not just for public hospitals: Many private hospitals also accept GLs. Just check with their billing department first.\n\n\nCombine with PhilHealth and HMO: GLs can be used alongside your existing coverage to drastically reduce your out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nRetroactive applications: Even if you’ve already been discharged, some agencies allow you to apply for a GL to help pay remaining balances.\n\n\nYou can use multiple GLs: If the bill is huge, try applying to several sources (e.g., PCSO + LGU + employer). PCSO prioritizes certain cases: They move faster for cancer patients, dialysis cases, and other life-threatening illnesses. \n\n\nWhy This Is Important\n\n\nGLs aren’t just for indigent patients - they’re for anyone facing unexpected medical costs. It’s a massively underrated option that can help you avoid debt, ease financial stress, and even save lives.\n\n\nShare This Tip\n\n\nIf you found this useful, share it with your family or friends. Most Filipinos don’t even know this is an option. Seriously, it could be the difference between someone struggling with debt or finding a solution to their hospital bills.\n\n\nLet me know if may nakalimutan ako na info.",

For example, yung congressman namin ay may funds sa PCMC at Heart Center, pero wala sa East Ave Medical. Kapag wala silang pondo sa ospital mo, they cannot provide a GL. And usually, para makakuha ng GL ay dapat may quotation na kayo from the hospital magkano aabutin, and they will input the exact amount on the letter (to the centavo), para saktong sakto sa pinasa mong quotations. If for any reason hindi mo nagamit lahat (e.g., may isang procedure na nabayaran mo na), pwede mong magamit yung remaining funds para sa ibang procedure na accepted ang GL (usually X-ray, lab works, simple tests). Also, may mga ospital na may sariling GL, such as sa PCMC, nagbigay sila ng GL dati for complete dental rehab, and from their own funds ito nanggaling. DSWD also offers cash if you opt for it (papipiliin if GL or cash, if cash then same-day ng pila binibigay).\n\nAlso note that most organizations/govt agency na nagbibigay ng GL ay pwede kayong mai-recommend ng ospital nyo directly, para maging secured yung pagpunta nyo ron. If endorsed kayo ng ospital, most likely magiging successful ang pagkuha nyo ng GL, tulad sa OVP at DSWD. Hanapin nyo lang yung social service ng ospital nyo, at magtanong kayo paano process nila.\n\nThis is based on personal experience, and may vary depending on your location/hospital/LGU.",

    "title": "Why my lola's sari sari store taught me more about finance that any finance guru could",
    "body": "Just wanted to share a realization I had a few days ago that I think would be valuable to this community...\n\n\nNung 15 years old ako, napilitan akong magbantay sa sari-sari store ni Lola. Pinilit ako ng parents ko kasi gusto nilang matutunan ko raw ang value ng hard work. Syempre, teennager pa lang ako nun, ang gusto ko lang, chill at tambay. Pero ngayon, as someone working a 9-to-5 job as a certified corp slave napapaisip ako: grabe, sobrang dami kong natutunan kay lola sa tindahan. Dahil sa stint ko sa tindahan niya, mas maayos akong mag-handle ng pera kumpara sa ibang ka-age ko. Hindi ko rin ma-imagine kung paano ko kakayanin ang adulting kung wala yung mga tinuro niya.\n\n\n1. Walang Cash Flow, Walang Asenso\n\n\nSi lola, walang Excel o QuickBooks, pero master niya ang cash flow. Tuwing umaga, binibilang niya yung laman ng kahon bago mag-restock. Kahit piso-piso lang ang kita, alam niya kung saan papunta at saan nanggagaling yung pera.\n\n\nLesson ko? Sa buhay (at budget), hindi lang importante yung malaki ang kita. Dapat siguraduhin mong hindi mas malaki yung gastos kaysa sa pumapasok na pera. Kahit gaano kalaki ang sweldo mo, kung sabog naman ang paggastos, aba, good luck!\n\n\n2. Small Moves Today, Big Gains Tomorrow\n\n\nSa sari-sari store, tingi-tingi ang benta—yung sachet ng shampoo, piso candy, o P10 na kornik. Akala mo, bariya lang. Pero sabi ni lola, “Ang maliit, pag pinagsama-sama, nagiging malaki.”\n\n\nGanito rin sa ipon. Kahit pa konti-konti lang ang nasisave mo bawat buwan, pag consistent, aangat din yan. Wag mong habulin yung \"get rich quick\" schemes - diyan natutulog ang financial heartbreak!\n\n\n3. Kita mo nga, pero baon ka pa rin?\n\n\nSi Lola hindi lang basta benta nang benta; alam niya kung magkano ang tubo. Kung tumaas ang presyo ng supplier, ayusin din niya yung presyo niya sa tindahan.\n\n\nLife hack: Dapat mindful ka rin sa mga gastusin mo. Hindi porket malaki kita mo eh pwede ka nang gastos dito, gastos doon. Kung wala kang tira pagkatapos ng sweldo, parang nagtatrabaho ka lang para sa iba.\n\n\n4. Trust is the real puhunan\n\n\nAng tindahan ni Lola? Social hub ng barangay. May tsismisan, may asaran, at may utangan (na minsan di na nababayaran, LOL). Pero alam mo, bumabalik ang mga tao kasi ramdam nila yung malasakit ni lola.\n\n\nLagi din sya nagbabayad on-time sa suppliers kaya nakuha niya ang tiwala nila lahat.\n\n\nReal talk: Whether career o negosyo, huwag mong gawing transaksyonal ang relationships. Alagaan mo ang tiwala ng tao. Kung totoo kang may malasakit, babalik at babalik sila sayo - kahit hindi ikaw ang pinakamura.\n\n\n5. Ipon Now, Luho Later\n\n\nMeron si Lola na isang lata ng \"puhunan\" na tinatago sa tindahan. Para saan? Emergencies! Kung biglang nagmahal ang bilihin o may kailangang bayaran, hindi siya nanghihiram—may back-up siya.\n\n\nIto yung mantra niya na nakakabit na sa utak ko: “Kung walang ipon, paano mo babangon?” At totoo nga, kasi kahit gaano ka kagaling sa pera, may mga panahon talagang susubukan ka ng buhay.\n\n\n6. Adjust fast or get left in the past\n\n\nDumami ang tindahan sa lugar namin, pero hindi nagpatalo si lola. Nagbenta siya ng mga di pangkaraniwang items - mga pasalubong na special o prepaid load nung sumikat ang cellphone.\n\n\nSabi niya, “Kung di ka marunong mag-adjust, kawawa ka.” Ganito rin sa personal finance. Hindi palaging smooth ang takbo ng investments o career mo. Kung hindi ka flexible, yari ka.\n\n\n----\n\nSadly, my lola was too old to manage the sari sari store and she had to shut it down eventually. Then, my lola passed away a few years ago. My experience with her and the sari sari store will stay with me forever.\n\n\nI’m curious if anyone here has similar stories. Feel free to share.\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up fast! Nakakatuwa naman na ang daming naka-relate! Ang saya basahin ng mga kwento nyo dito sa comments, parang naaalala ko tuloy si lola 😢. Tuloy-tuloy lang sa kwentuhan, nakakagood vibes talaga!\n",

    "title": "Everything I Learned Buying A House in the Philippines",
    "body": "# Background\n\nI bought a renovated house from the secondhand market via cash (DP + installment payments direct to the seller for 1 year). Yes, my husband and I are high earners, but we opted for a 4M starter home as I know that there will be extra costs in getting a house.\n\n# Due diligence\n\n* No banks were involved in the purchase. Next time, I will definitely involve the bank so they can do the verification themselves.\n* **Reservation -** My first mistake. I really liked the property and paid reservation fees right away after 2 visits. This is stupid. You have the upperhand because it’s hard to sell a real estate property. Take your time in checking everything, negotiate for lower price and CGT to be handled by seller.\n* **Property inspection -** As the house was renovated, I had to check the following: plumbing, electricity, pests, waterproofing, sewage system and water lines. Just ask ChatGPT on what to check or bring a contractor to give you an estimate of the issues.\n* **Community issues -** I joined Facebook groups (HOA or buy & sell groups) to check the usual prices of utility bills, common issues with the admin, best internet service providers, flooding, crimes, etc.\n* **Floods and fault lines -** I also checked Project Noah to see if the area is prone to flooding or will flood in the future. Check Tiktoks, youtube videos and facebook posts!\n* **Property appreciation -** Future plans in the area were also considered, such as new expressways or malls being built nearby.\n\n# Are you getting scammed?\n\n* **Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) -** The seller may only have the TCT if they are the second owner. You should verify the TCT at the Registry of Deeds (RD) yourself as it only takes three days and costs Php 300 pesos. You just need to show photocopy of TCT, ID of owner and amilyar. Most people complain that the RDs have long lines but it's short if you're just going verification of TCT, unlike for cancellation or transfer of title. Don’t trust the agents on this, you have to do this yourself. The seller should have a version of the TCT called the \"owner’s copy\" with them.\n   * If the title is really clean, there won’t be any encumbrances. If it's not, then it's not clean. Our title had a mortgage encumbrance on it, which made me worry. I went to a lawyer and he said that if they give a notarized \"cancellation of mortgage,\" that’s good enough and we can clean it ourselves.\n   * Tax Declaration - They will show you the “amilyar” or the receipt to show that it’s paid recently. You can go to Assessor's Office to verify that. We didn’t go anymore because it’s just Php 1000 per year and we got lazy. Lawyer doesn’t need this, more on that later.\n\n# Best way to pay?\n\n* Pay via bank. The costliest way to buy a property is with cash, but I just moved back so I can't really take out a loan.\n* A manager's check is recommended, especially if you're paying in millions. Don't pay with cash. This is as good as cash, and only the owner can deposit it into their bank. It's safer than post-dated checks too.\n* Thanks to you guys, I learned that there's no limit to post-dated checks in the Philippines, so the balance is being paid in PDCs over a year.\n\n# Legal Stuff\n\n* **Contract to Sell** is created if the property is in installment and notary offices charge 1% of the property value, you can negotiate.\n   * **Verify notary firm -** Don’t be cheap here. I switched notary firms because I don’t trust the cheap notary office they recommended - no Google reviews, new firm and they also have a coffee shop. We opted for a lawyer with a notary office who's been in the same building since I was a kid. Of course, he cares more about our interest and put a lot of buyer protection clauses. It's much easier to pay more for a legit lawyer than chase a runaway seller!\n   * **Review all info before signing** \\- Ensure that the title number, ID numbers, seller's and buyers name are correct.\n   * **Terms** \\- It should itemize all of the payment terms and all of the documents that the seller needs to provide\n   * **Seller's deliverables:** All keys, old deed of sale from previous owner, notarized cancelation of mortgage, meralco bill, water bill, certificate of tax declaration for lot and building (those two are separate), TCT from RD, authority to move in. Seller will hold the owner’s copy of TCT until you’re paid or depends on your negotiation. Safest way is to keep it in a safe or add an encumbrance saying it's under a contract of sale, kasi they can still mortgage the property or sell it to another person.\n   * **Move-in requirements:** It's important to check with the admin office or homeowner's association about their requirements for moving in and to ensure that the seller can provide any necessary documents or certifications during the contract selling process. This may include things like proof of ownership, water or electricity bills, clearance from the barangay or homeowner's association, and more.\n\n# Transfer of Title\n\nYou should only get the DOAS after it’s fully paid or else you’ll get penalties as some taxes are due within 30 days of notarization. The previous notary wanted to issue this right away 🤦‍♀️ We'll probably just hire the same law firm to handle this for us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Fees in transferring the title|Description|Deadline|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Deed of Absolute Sale|Additional 1% fee, executed once property is fully paid|Within 30 days to start transfer of title process|\n|Documentary Stamp Tax (DST)|1.5% of selling price|5th day after notarizing DOAS|\n|Registration Fees|0.5% of selling price||\n|Notary Fees|1% to 1.5% of selling price||\n|Capital Gains Tax (CGT)|6% of selling price ⚠️ Yes, it’s **6 percent** that’s why this is generally negotiated with the seller, let them pay for it haha. Most notary offices will execute DOAS showing half of the total contract price so they can save in the CGT and that’s completely fine.|Within 30 days after notarization of DOAS|\n|Transfer Tax|0.75% of selling price|varies depending on municipality area, 60 days after notarizing DOAS|\n|Real Property Tax (RPT)||Must be updated before transfer of title for payment of transfer tax|\n\n**Make room in your budget for unexpected expenses:**\n\n* This is why we opted for a more affordable property to allow some room for unexpected expenses. As you can see, legal fees alone can cost quite a bit.\n* After closing, consider your furniture needs, then appliances, and finally any necessary repairs or upgrades such as a fence or window grills.\n\nThis was scary and stressful for us, and I hope this helps! It's funny, if we had just spent this much time buying stocks, we would have been multimillionaires by now haha.",

If the property is bought via mortgage, it is very likely the original owner’s copy of TCT is kept by the bank/lender and will process the annotation in the title with RD to record collateral. When the mortgage is fully paid, the bank/lender will give back the original owner’s copy and notarized cancellation of mortgage. There’s only one original owner’s copy. When you verify with the Registry of Deeds, they will just issue you a certified true copy of the TCT. CTC TCT are always dated so you will know if it is a recent copy or not.",

    "title": "Na-Scam ka na ba ng VUL? Here's what they're not telling you",
    "body": "A few years ago, isang financial advisor (na tropa ko pa!) ang nag-alok ng VUL. \"Perfect to bro\" sabi niya, \"may life insurance ka na, may investment ka pa!\" Syempre, sino ba naman ang hindi ma-hype? Dalawang kailangan sa buhay - insurance at investment - sa isang hulog lang? Ang galing ng offer.\n\nNag-start ako maghulog ng P3,000/month. After a few years, naisip ko i-check kung magkano na ang “investment” value ko.\n\nAkala ko naman medyo malaki na kasi ang total na hinulog ko was over P100,000. Pero eto ang masakit: ang naiwan sa investment ko?\n\nLESS THAN HALF.\n\nPaano nangyari yun? More details on that, later.\n\nKwento ng kaibigan ko naman:\n\nShe's a mom of two na naghulog ng P5,000/month for five years. Dapat daw, magagamit na niya yung investment for her kids' college fund. Pero nung nagtanong siya kung magkano na ang fund value niya, halos himatayin siya: less than P80,000! Eh P300,000 na yung hinulog niya. Nagka-trust issues siya after nun, hindi lang sa VUL kundi pati sa mga \"financial advisors\".\n\nSaan napunta ang pera ko?\n\n\nHere’s the truth about VUL na hindi sinasabi sayo upfront:\n\n1. Malaki ang commission ng financial advisor\n\n\nYes, besh. Yung kausap mo, usually gets 40-50% of your first-year premium as commission. So kung naghulog ka ng P3,000/month, halos P18,000 sa first year napunta sa kanila. At hindi lang siya! Yung managers nila? May cut din. Kaya bago pa umabot sa investment, ubos na.\n\n\n2. Ang daming charges:\n\n\nInsurance charges: Habang tumatanda ka, mas lumalaki ang portion ng premium mo na napupunta sa insurance fee.\n\nAdmin fees: May fees pa for maintaining your account.\n\nInvestment charges: Kapag yung natira mong pera, pinasok sa funds, may fees din dito na kinakain ang returns. Kaya kahit kumita ang market, parang wala kang napapala.\n\n\n3. Kapag tumigil ka sa hulog, goodbye pera mo.\n\n\nHindi totoo yung \"investment\" na iniisip mo. Sa VUL, may minimum na taon na dapat kang maghulog (lock-in period). Kung tumigil ka bago mo ito matapos, forfeited ang pera mo. Yes, kahit ilang taon mo na itong binayaran.\n\n\n4. Walang guarantee kapag nalugi ang fund.\n\n\nAng investments sa VUL nakadepende sa market. Kapag bumagsak ang fund na pinili mo, lugi ka. At kung sakaling magka-issue ang company, hindi rin nila guaranteed na mababayaran ka—hindi sila obligated na i-cover ang nawala mong \"investment.\"\n\n----\n\nAng VUL ay parang toxic na relationship: ikaw ang bigay nang bigay, pero wala kang nakukuhang balik. At yung financial advisor mo? Kumita na sayo upfront. Kahit magka-loss ka sa dulo, sila safe na. Kaya nga tuwing sinasabi ko ito sa mga finance-related Facebook groups, ang daming nagagalit. Bakit? Dahil ito yung kabuhayan nila. Pero, eto ang tanong: bakit natin tinotolerate ang ganitong predatory practices?\n\nLet’s stop normalizing these predatory practices. Marami pang mas maayos na investment like term insurance, uitfs and etfs na mas mura and barely any fees.\n\nKung may VUL ka na, reevaluate mo. And if you're planning to get one, pause muna. Aralin mo mabuti. Sa dulo, pera mo yan. You deserve to keep it. Wag mo nang ipaubaya sa VUL.\n\nUPDATE 1: ang daming Financial Advisors na galit sakin kasi daw mawawalan sila ng kita dahil sa post na to. Pero honestly, happy ako na maraming nagse-share ng experiences nila sa predatory VULs. Tuloy niyo lang! The more stories we share, the more people we help.\n\nUPDATE 2: Ang dami laging nagsasabi na ‘basahin kasi yung kontrata.’ Tapos parang kasalanan pa ng customer na hindi nila naintindihan. Eh diba nga, konti lang naman talaga ang nagbabasa ng kontrata? Aminin mo, binasa mo ba terms and conditions ng Gmail, Reddit, or Facebook bago ka sumali?\n\nAlam din naman natin na hindi ganun kalakas ang reading comprehension ng karamihan sa atin. Kaya kung ang daming nagrereklamo na na-budol sila dahil sa false advertising ng FA, edi ibig sabihin may mali sa sistema. Dapat siguro gumawa ng mas klarong rules yung IC or government para lahat ng kukuha, fully aware kung ano ba talaga pinapasok nila.\n\nAng masaklap pa, ito din kadalasan ang ginagamit na dahilan ng mga nagtatrabaho sa insurance para i-justify yung mga naloko—‘Kasalanan mo yan, hindi ka nagbasa.’ Pero sa totoo lang, may responsibilidad din ang FA at insurance company na gawing simple at transparent ang mga terms.\n\nUPDATE 3: What Should Happen (kung magstrictly regulate ang Insurance Commission):\n\nFA: Hello, ma’am/sir! Alok ko lang po sainyo itong VUL offer namin. It’s an insurance product combined with an investment. Pero gusto ko lang i-clear na hindi guaranteed ang returns.\n\nFor example, kung mag-invest po kayo ng P400k, P270k na lang ang mapupunta sa actual investment kasi yung balance po ay napupunta sa fees and commissions. Nandito po lahat ng details sa dokumentong ito—please take the time to read it before signing.\n\nGusto ko rin pong sabihin na kung mag-withdraw kayo early, may penalties, at baka hindi niyo makuha yung full amount ng hinulog ninyo.\n\nKung ang goal niyo po ay protection lang, we also offer term insurance or life insurance. Mas mura siya at straightforward, so it might suit your needs better.\n\nLet me know po kung ano ang mas swak sa goals nyo!\n\nWhat Actually Happens:\n\nFA: Hello, ma’am/sir! May investment opportunity ako for you na siguradong lalaki ang pera niyo. Bonus pa, may insurance coverage pa! Protected na kayo, tapos malaki pa kikitain niyo pag nag-retire. Eto na po ang kontrata - sign na dito!\n\nSee the difference? Sa tamang presentation, transparent lahat ng details at options, kaya mas informed yung client. Pero kadalasan, parang hard sell na agad without fully explaining the risks and charges. Kaya ang daming naloloko.\n\nUPDATE 4: It’s crazy how people keep saying it’s just the FA’s fault, as if the insurance provider has nothing to do with it. Eh sino ba nag-hire at nag-train sa mga FA? Obviously, the insurance company. If there’s deception, they’re the ones who taught it. Ang dami nang reklamo, pero walang accountability.\n\nAnd most of the time, the FA is a friend or relative, kaya kahit naloko ka, you won’t complain - friendship over or tahimik ka na lang sa family reunion.\n\nTapos people blame the clients for not doing research? Eh FA nga ang pinaniwalaan kasi ‘advisor’ daw sila. And then they say pinoys just want a get-rich scheme? Pero sino ba nagsasabi na ‘investment’ ang VUL? Hindi ba yun FA? Try dropping by a bank and inquiring about VULs - let’s see if the pitch is more focused on insurance or investment. Puro budol.\n\nAt the end of the day, pare-pareho lang ang VUL product, regardless kung sino ang FA - same commission, same predatory shitty fees.\n\nThe VUL product IS the problem. Yung mga FAs gustong gusto ilihis ang issue.\n\nGrabe, after ko i-post ito, sobrang dami pala talagang nabiktima ng VUL. May isang tao pa na inuto na time deposit daw, yun pala VUL. Tapos nung nasa ospital yung magulang niya at kailangan na yung pera, hindi nila makuha. Ang sakit at sobrang nakakagalit isipin.\n\nMasakit makita na pinaghirapan mo, hindi mo man lang magamit nung panahon na kailangan na kailangan mo.\n\nUPDATE 5: From insurance employee insiders:\n\nu/kur0nek0999\n\n\"I worked in an insurance company na may VUL. Totoo to. At most agents don't disclose these infos. Maraming nag cacancel agad ng policy once makita ung first statement. Sadly ung iba after cool off period na nacacancel so may loss na talaga.\n\nAng hanap ko nalang na insurance ngayon ay yung pure insurance lang. Kahit pay until specific age.\n\nJust invest the rest of your money somewhere else.\"\n\nu/SnooPoems2582\n\n\"I work in an insurance company. Hindi sa insurance related department pero kasama sa requirements namin is to understand Life and Non-Life Insurance.\n\nComputation is based also on age and yung risk. So tama na tumataas yan, and once nadiagnose ka ng critical illness, you can get your claim and hindi ka na insurable.\n\nAgree ako kay OP, and natutunan ko yan when I entered the insurance industry. Critical na dapat naiintindihan ng clients yung mga nasabi dito, because all of it are true.\n\nBelow are some of the things I learned while working with underwriters / claims analyst:\n\nAng VUL should be sold sa value proposition na ipuput-first ang insurance, at hindi investment.\n\nRemember that insurance is an expense at hindi investment. You are paying for your peace of mind by passing the risk sa insurance agency for a certain fee. Investment grows overtime, insurance becomes more expensive as time goes by.\n\nClaims undergo evaluation ng claims analyst. Look at your contract na napakahaba, kasi nakasulat doon kaylan ka lang makakaclaim at ano anong bagay yung pwedeng magcause ng claim denial. This must be discussed IN DETAIL ng FA mo. Kapag hindi makasagot FA mo, hanap ka iba. Kasi ang magagaling na FA helps ensure maayos ang claims requirements mo para pumasa ka sa claims evaluation. They also help you manage expectation through clarifying everything from the start.\n\nA good insurance company is measured sa claims ratio nya, which is gaano kadaming claims request ang nagagrant vs sa total claims request received. Ask your FA about this. Minsan kasi masisilaw ka dyan eh, may nakaclaim na 3m, pero ang tanong dapat is ilan ang nagfile ng claims na nagrant compared sa total. Makikita mo at maliit lang yan.\n\nLastly, mahalaga na insured ka, whether ano mang product yan, pero mas mahalaga na nainsure ka sa tamang product. Look at the list of critical illness covered, look at paano ang claims process, etc.\n\nShawtawt kay OP for this educational post at sa mga responsableng FA.\n\nsa mga indenial, nako mag isip isip kayo kasi hindi araw araw you will encounter such post.\"\n\nUPDATE 6:\n\nFYI: VULs come in many names, so double-check before committing.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the creative branding.

        "body": "VUL sounds good in paper pero not in a way advisors glorify it. Because sometimes mismong advisor di nila gets yung small print ng pinepresent nila.\n\nMay tatlong uri ng advisor, \nAdvisor 1 are actually deceitful they know pero di nila sinasama sa explanation.\nAdvisor 2 are the baguhan. Di nila truly gets pero they explain it on how they are told.\nAdvisor 3 are the ethical ones. They won't sell to you products na hindi sila personally convinced.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I also don't like or recommend VULs. I got one when I was younger kasi nasilaw din sa potential earnings, although naexplain naman ng advisor ko ng maayos.\n\nHere's just a few more clarification and also agreement in your points\n\n\n1. Malaki ang commission ng financial advisor\n\nThis one is true, malaki ang commission ng advisor sa first year payment. Pero don't take it as binubulsa nila ang pera mo, you pay it directly sa company and company ang magbibigay sa advisor.  Makikita mo sa proposal na malaki ang charges on the first three years compared sa mga susunod. Which is supposed to be shown and explained during proposal.\n\n\n2. Ang daming charges:\n\nTrue. Most charges are not specifically listed down and ang stated in the proposal na binibigay could be actual charges or estimates. Pero since VUL, estimated charges niyan. \nExample is yung nakuha ko. \n36000 a year ang payment. Charges for 1st year: 25k. Charges for 2nd year: 19k. Charges for 3rd year: 13k. \nCharges for 4th year: 9k. Charges for 5th year: 8k. And so on. Pero on the fine print: \"Charges based on 4% investment return\". Which means magbabago siya depende sa performance ng investment. (Hinanap ko talaga lumang proposal na binigay para basahin ulit.)\n\n\n3. Kapag tumigil ka sa hulog, goodbye pera mo. \n\nThis one is both TRUE and FALSE.\nDito actually pumapasok ang advantage ng VUL. Since may investment part, as long as may fund value ang account mo, buhay ang plan mo kahit hindi ka makapagbayad ng ilang months. Pero of course, pag nasimot na yung fund value, dyan na papasok yung TRUE. Goodbye na sa payments mo.\nYung VUL ko nakuha ko ng 2021. Kumpleto ako for the 1st year and half nung next year sa payment kaso nawalan ako ng work so binabayaan ko na. Chineck ko this 2024, buhay pa rin. Nilalagyan ko na lang siya pag paubos na yung fund value para buhay yung insurance. Pero di na ko nageexpect sa investment part.\n\n\n\n4. Walang guarantee kapag nalugi ang fund.\n\nThis one is just actually how investment works. There's no guarantee on the returns. Ang ipapakita sa inyo sa proposal is 0% 4% or 8%. Pero it can go lower.\n\n----\n\nAnd also to note yung minimum years to pay, estimated lang din yun. May chance na magextend pa if pangit ng performance ng investment.\n\n\nKaya maraming nabablindside because hindi pinapaliwanag yung important details like\n\"Projected Benefits\" - yung pinapakita na kikitain mo raw is example lang kung ganun ang performance ng investment pero most often hindi naman ganun kataas ang actual return.\n\"Riders\" - mga addons na nakakadagdag sa charges pero you have the option to actually remove.\nAnd most importantly minamarket siya as investment when in fact ang priority ng VUL is life insurance which is kumakain ng pera.\n\n\nWhich is why hindi practical ang VUL. Investments is supposed to grow your money pero dinedrain nung insurance charges. So it's best to get them separately.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, make sure to fully understand before you commit into anything. Kahit gaano pa kapleasing ang pagkaexplain sa inyo. \nYou'll find other better products to suit your life.",

We took pride in buying this property and being a homeowner. \n\nNow, I completely regret buying this property, and all my neighbors share the same sentiments.

Right now, construction workers have been working day and night (and yes, EVEN DURING SLEEPING HOURS) just to get this project done asap. \n\nThis property developer has NO respect for its buyers. Never even gave its homeowners a heads up regarding the plans. Never even decided to consult or discuss with the subdivision on how we can prepare and make changes. As it is, the soil here is already soft. Our boundary wall is currently sinking, and the rest of the homeowners are preparing for structural damages all because of this stupid road.\n\nWe’re already looking for properties to move to because our experience has been extremely disappointing.

    "body": "Renting to family? Never again.\n\nFor 10 years, my aunt's family rented our 150sqm, 2 Bedroom w/ 2 car parking home for just Php10K/month which was WAY below market rate. (Sa area namin, similar units rent for Php25K - Php30K/month) \n\nPero since family, pinagbigyan na lang namin. We also had no choice because our dad was the one who allowed them.\n\nWala kaming contract, walang security deposit, walang advance.\n\nWe finally needed the house, so we asked them to move out. I won't mention the details, pero sumama loob nila sa amin, and umabot pa sa iyakan at drama. We offered them another property, but they said it was a shithole (it wasn't a shithole, but I think entitled lang sila)\n\nThen the real nightmare began.\n\n- They stopped paying rent for the last 3 months. Walang bayad kasi daw \"pamilya naman kami\"\n\n- They refused to shoulder any of the cleaning or repairs.\n\n- It took 10 days to fully clean their unit. The stench was putrid as hell. Any person would probably vomit from the smell alone. Amoy patay na daga, itlog ng ipis, and panis na pagkain all rolled into one.\n\n- 2 truckloads of trash ang iniwan nila. They were hoarders. Hindi lang kalat kundi basura. Parang dumpsite.\n\n- Sinks and toilets barado. Di ko alam kung anong binaon nila dun.\n\n- Cabinets destroyed. Hingal ang carpenter sa dami ng sira. Puru mold, and water damage. Yung ibang aparador ginawang patungan ng pagkain ng pets nila.\n\n- Cockroaches and rats INFESTED the place. Pati pest control napapikit sa nakita nila. We caught over 30 rats, and about hundreds of coackroaches.\n\n- Total cost to fix everything was Php200k\n\nI thought to myself: \"how can anyone live like this?\"\n\nAfter all that, sila pa ang galit sa amin. Kami pa daw ang masama. Ayaw na kaming kausapin. Wala na daw sila pera matitira kasi ang mamahal na daw ng upa sa iba with the same layout as ours. Wala din daw trabaho anak nila ages 40-45y/o, and magreretire na sila.\n\nFor 10 years, we gave them a massive discount (Php10K vs. market rate of Php25K–Php30K), no rent increases, and all the flexibility they wanted.\n\nPero nung kami na ang may kailangan? Biglang wala nang utang na loob.\n\nLesson Learned: If you own real estate, maybe it’s NOT a good idea to rent to relatives. Minsan, masisira hindi lang bahay mo — pati relasyon niyo.\n\nI shared this story to my friends, and lahat sila may kanya kanyang horror stories. Common ba talaga ito?\n\nI was really bothered by this, and couldn't sleep for a few days. I also had panic attacks. Mga pinsan ko from their family hindi man lang nagsorry. And I thought we had such a good relationship.",

The same problems crop up. The proliferation of these kinds of posts overwhelming /u/treeperfume is what prompted me to become a mod. The overwhelming of me is what prompted /u/speqter to become a mod.\n\nMaybe the answer isn't so much that we need new rules and new approaches, as it is we just need more mod eyes on the posts to help us tighten up the discussion a bit?\n\nShould we head in that direction first (adding additional mods to trim/prune posts), and circle back in a bit to see if that helps push the ship in a better direction?",

Of course it will seem fictional to some especially para dun sa mga tao na tumanda na lang kakatrabaho e minimum wage earner pa din.\n\nThe reality is despite getting the opportunities to earn huge amounts of money some people are still unsure how to properly handle their finances. Ability to make money != Ability to manage money. Magkaibang magkaiba yun. I know some people who earn mid to high 6 digit salaries and still live paycheck to paycheck because they never knew how to manage their finances especially those who grew up poor and were never taught any money management skills. \n\n\n\nNow, I'm not discounting the possibility that maybe some of the posts made here are fictional and that some people here seem harsh when commenting on other people's financial situations but hey it's an investment focused sub and it would always attract people who value money and its proper management highly and to those who are financially irresponsible these people would always seem fictional and harsh.\n\nTbh to me those posts from the other sub reek of inggit and insecurity. Meron nga ako nabasa nag unsub daw dito dahil pag nakikita nya sweldo ng mga mas bata sa kanya na IT devs nalulugmok sya and nadedepress. Anong tawag dun? \n\nAlso regarding posting figures of your salary and portfolio, it's not bragging if it's real and it is related to your question. Imagine asking if you can afford to buy a house and only saying that you're earning \"sakto lang nakakaipon naman kahit papano kada buwan\" instead of \"i earn 200k net monthly\"\n\nDiba?\n\nTry mo gawin yan sa ibang investment sub auto remove ang post mo.

    "body": "To the redditor who asked how to get rich in his 30s through investing:\n\nI hate to break it to you, but you’re not gonna get rich young with investing. The 1% is called the 1% for a simple, self-evident mathematical reason. So, don’t come here thinking you’ll strike gold in investing. That requires big enough capital in the first place.\n\nMost investing is the preservation of wealth against the corrosive power of inflation over money. Wise investments get a little bit more. And time rewards that, but only after a long while.\n\nIf you want to get rich quick, create an enterprise or perform a service that fulfills a demand people are willing to pay big money for, or scam people – in the public or private sectors -- or be extremely lucky. If you knew how to do any of the three, or are willing to do any of them, you wouldn’t need the advice of any of us here.\n\nThe good news is, getting rich isn’t the point of life. It’s not a human tragedy that one is able to live a happy life with a happy family and fulfilling hobbies in plain middle-classness. One doesn’t always have to be in the cream of the crop. If, at the end of a well-lived life, one is eulogized with “he wasn’t rich, but he lived comfortably enough to be a decent and happy person,” that’s not such a bad way to go.\n\nHappiness is a function of contentment, not money. That's why you should keep your expectations reasonable. Now, of course, there is a level of financial status that makes for valid discontent. And there is certainly a level of comfort that money buys. Above that level, every additional peso gets marginally less enjoyable than the previous peso. I'm personally worth something in the low eight figures (much of it not my own doing and not by my own merit). But I never bought myself any gadget or personal luxury above 30k. I'm just happy I get to buy myself a nice bowl of bulalo when I want one. Money has its limits when it comes to making one happy.\n\nInvesting is the passive accumulation of wealth over a lifetime. Time rewards correct decisions with dignified old age. Sometimes, you do get rich with investing – at 60 or something, after more than a generation of correct and patient decisions.\n\nNow just because you can’t get rich doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest. The alternative – an unprepared life – is awful. Keep your expectations reasonable but your efforts excellent. I assure you, you will exceed your expectations and be all the happier for doing so. Learn on your own. We at r/phinvest can be good sources of “leads,” but otherwise, you’re on your own, dude.\n\nI’m sure all of us wish you well, though. So, you can count on our goodwill, our friendship, and our advice.\n\nTake care and keep in touch with all of us here in this little corner of reddit.",

It may look simple and doable, so to pull me back from my envious misery, I asked how much it costs him to buy the land and it’s not even his.

    "body": "Noong una, akala ko ang pinaka-stressful na part ng real estate investment ay ang pag-ipon ng pang-downpayment. Mali pala ako. Mas mahirap pala ang bawiin ang mismong lupa mo — dahil may ibang taong nauna nang tumira doon.\n\nGanito nagsimula yung gulo namin.\n\n# Ang Lupa Na May Libreng Pamilya\n\nMatagal nang may biniling lupa ang parents ko. Hindi nila natirhan agad, pero bayad lahat—title, tax, etc. Fast forward years later, sabi ng parents ko, “O, anak, ayusin mo na ‘yung lupa. Pwede nating i-benta or pa-upahan.”\n\nSo pumunta ako para tignan ang property. Dala ko pa ‘yung mindset na “Aba, ito na ang unang hakbang sa pagyaman!”\n\nPagdating ko, may bubong. May pader. May kurtina. May tao.\n\nNagkatinginan kami nung lalaking nasa harap ng bahay. Ako, nagtataka. Siya, parang defensive agad.\n\n“Sino ‘yan?” tanong ng babae sa loob.\n\nAko dapat ‘yung nagtatanong niyan, diba?\n\nSabi ko, \"Boss, sa amin po itong lupa. Kailan pa po kayo nandito?\"\n\n\"Matagal na.\"\n\nAba. Ang confident.\n\nSabi ko ulit, \"Eh alam niyo bang may may-ari ‘to?\"\n\n\"Eh kasi iniwan lang naman ‘to ng matagal, eh.\"\n\nAy, ganun pala ‘yun? So pag iniwan ko ‘yung kotse ko sa parking ng SM ng isang taon, kanila na?\n\n# Ang Pakiusap Na Walang Nangyari\n\nSinubukan kong dumaan sa maayos na usapan. Baka naman pwede nilang intindihin na kailangan na namin gamitin ‘yung lupa.\n\n\"Wala po kaming ibang matutuluyan.\"\n\n‘Yan na. First line of defense palagi.\n\nSo dinala ko sa barangay. Ang ini-expect ko, makakatulong sila sa pag-facilitate ng tamang proseso. Ang nakuha ko?\n\n\"Pag-usapan niyo na lang po.\"\n\nWalang kwenta. Walang nangyari. Tatlong beses akong pabalik-balik sa barangay para lang marinig ‘yung parehong sagot.\n\nDoon ko na-realize, walang mangyayari dito. Kailangan na ng abogado.\n\n# Ang Totoong Laban: Magkano Ba Ang Ejectment Case?\n\nNagpa-consult ako sa abogado. Sabi niya, may proseso ‘to - file ejectment case, serve notice, hintayin ang court order. Madali lang sa papel. Pero sa totoong buhay? Walang madali.\n\n**Gastos Breakdown (Approximate):**  \n**- Lawyer’s acceptance fee:** ₱50,000 (Kahit basic case, mahal talaga)  \n**- Filing fees:** ₱10,000  \n**- Sheriff & court-related fees:** ₱7,000  \n**- Miscellaneous (affidavits, documents, notarization, pamasahe sa hearings, etc.):** ₱5,000-₱10,000  \n**- Lost time and stress:** *Priceless* 😭\n\nTotal na **mahigit ₱70,000** para bawiin ang **sarili mong property**. Samantalang sila? Libre silang nakatira for years.\n\n# Ang Tagal ng Proseso: Bakit Ganito Kahirap?\n\nEjectment cases usually take 6 months to 1 year, pero sa amin? Halos 1 taon!\n\n* **1st month:** File ng complaint, waiting game para sa first hearing\n* **2nd-5th month:** Barangay mediation (Walang nangyari, puro palusot)\n* **6th-10th month:** Court proceedings, attend hearings, hintay ng decision\n* **11th-12th month:** Final court order + execution (saka pa lang napilitan umalis)\n\nHalos isang taon, tapos ₱70K ang gastos, at ilang leaves sa trabaho ang nasayang para lang mapaalis ang hindi dapat nandiyan in the first place.\n\nAt kahit may court decision na, hindi pa rin sila agad umalis. Kailangan pang dumating ang sheriff, kasama ang pulis, para tuluyan silang mapaalis.\n\nNoong araw na ‘yon, nakita ko silang nag-iimpake, tahimik lang, walang drama. Wala na ‘yung galit, wala na ‘yung sigaw. Kasi wala na silang laban.\n\nAt doon ko naisip: **Hindi pala ako masama. Tama lang talaga ako.**\n\n# Para Sa Mga May Ganitong Problema, Eto Ang Natutunan Ko:\n\n**- Huwag maghintay.** The longer they stay, the harder it is to eject them.  \n**- Legal agad.** Barangay settlements rarely work; ejectment case ang tunay na sagot.  \n**- Huwag magpa-awa.** Hindi ikaw ang kontrabida dito, ikaw ang may-ari.  \n**- Secure your property.** Kung may bakanteng lote kayo, ipa-fence niyo na agad. Prevention is better than eviction.\n\nAkala ko dati, basta may titulo ka, wala ka nang iisipin. Mali pala. Sa Pilipinas, ang tunay na laban ay hindi lang sa pagbili ng property kundi sa pagprotekta nito.\n\nSo kung may lupa kayong matagal nang iniwan, check niyo na. Baka may “bonus tenants” na rin kayo.",

    "title": "UPDATE: Launched a Salon at the end of January. ₱3.5M in Sales; ₱1.1M Net Year-To-Date",
    "body": "For anyone who missed my original post you can find it [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1d84qaz/launched_a_salon_at_the_end_of_january_this_month/).\n\nI've been meaning to put together an update for a few weeks but have been pushing it off. Mostly because I'm not quite sure how to structure these updates. I think the original post was relatively thorough on our start up process and how we gathered sales, at this point I don't think things will get a lot more interesting. So what I think might be fun to do is to include a bunch of lessons I learn as I grow this salon with my co-owners.\n\nJust like last time, I'm posting to brainstorm idea and help others who are looking to get started. Ask away as much as you want and share any insights that you have.\n\nJumping right into what people care the most, the numbers!\n\n*^(\\*numbers in table are rounded off to make it fit.)*\n\n|May|June|July|August|September|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sales|₱406,700|₱591,500|₱504,700|₱574,900|₱581,000|\n|Expenses|-₱253,527|-₱352,863|-₱295,512|-₱403,652|-₱455,838|\n|Profit|₱153,173|₱238,637|₱209,188|₱171,248|₱125,162|\n\nI left off my last post slightly worried about rainy season and months people call \"Ghost\" months, but as you can see, there definitely weren't any ghosts around for us. In fact, May to June was our largest jump in sales so far increasing by 45.5% MoM.\n\nHonestly nothing really out of the extraordinary happened during July except for a larger push on advertising. I mentioned in my last post that I was looking to remarketing to old customers which didn't happen, honestly it just kind of slipped my mind in June.\n\n# July\n\nThis is where things started to get interesting because it was our first month where sales were lower than the month before. Couple of things contributed to the downtrend in sales from what I could tell:\n\n1. Our CAC (customer acquisition cost) spiked significantly going from ₱324 to ₱409. Feeding into this was a decrease in efficiency from our ads, it cost us more to get people into our funnel which in turn made the conversion cost a lot more. Honestly this was my fault which leads me to my first lesson.\n\n**Lesson 1: Don't be complacent**\n\nFrom Jan to mid April I pushed really hard on making sure I get plenty of creatives for advertising, whether it is a new video concept, more images etc. I made a rookie mistake and just paused the flow of creatives available for advertising to me, this also meant organic posts stopped. I kept telling myself \"next week, next week\", well, weeks turned into months and before I knew it, ads started to fatigue, costs started to shoot up and I was now playing catch up trying to create as much content as possible. I've since asked the team to help me create more videos and images on a consistent basis.\n\n2. Coming out of May's busy month of graduations, mother's day and other events, I was really surprised our internal metrics remained all the same in June but I really felt the downtrend in demand in July where people seemed interested, but didn't convert. Our average conversion rate up until July was around 7.5%, that dropped down to 4%.\n\n3. The weather sucked - and continued to suck for August and September with all the rain and typhoons people just didn't want to go and I don't blame them.\n\n4. Customers didn't avail of as many high ticket services. Prior to July, our average value per customer stepping into the salon was about 2.35K in June that dropped down to 2K in July. It doesn't sound like a lot but if enough people show up those ₱350 that are missing gets noticed. Honestly, not sure why it happened, I talked to our hairdressers if they noticed anything odd for July but everything seemed normal. One thing I noticed on the data side is a significant drop in \"Balayage\" hair color services (at the time our highest ticket item), a drop of more than half while our \"cheaper\" lower end packages were availed more.\n\nSo how did we increase sales after July when fewer people showed up, their value dropped and it was more expensive to advertise?\n\n**Lesson 2: It's easier to increase revenue by selling higher ticket services to your customers than it is to increase the number of new customers.**\n\nSo to reference some quick numbers,\n\n|Month|No. of customers|\n|:-|:-|\n|**July**|245|\n|**August**|246|\n|**September**|219|\n\nNotice how in August we had almost the same number of customers as July but sales were ₱70K higher in Aug. It's even more obvious when you look at September numbers, our CVR dropped, we saw 10% drop in number of customers but revenue increased MoM by ₱7K.\n\nEssentially what happened is we started looking for higher value services we could offer and stumbled upon a product that's relatively popular in Manila but not as much where I live. It's a premium product that's about 30% higher in value than our other services.\n\nSo how do we convince customers to buy the premium services? We just ask them lol. We put a lot of emphasis on explaning why it's better, what the benefits are and even have before/after pictures of our past customers to help convince them. Most people want beautiful hair and if they're willing to spend 2.5K on a basic package, it's not too hard to  ask them for an additional 1k for a premium option and later on additonal 500 for something else, so it snowballs sometimes.\n\nThis new product also happens to be perfect for people we would typically have to reject due to their hair status. If someone shows up with \"unhealthy\" hair, there really isn't much we can do in terms of straightening or coloring, it'll just further damage the hair, but with this product we're able to help start the recovery process while also getting pretty close to what they're looking for.\n\n# August & September\n\nWe started to bounce back despite the rain and weather not being on our side. Really the only thing that saved us from what should have been terrible months for us was that new service.\n\nDuring these months we also decided to hire 3 new people. 2 Sr. hairstylist and 1 hair wash boy.\n\nWe are getting ready for the \"Ber\" months rush, historically from the original branch they see up to 20 people a day in November and December, knowing this we wanted to be proactive and bring on people who could help us handle the additional customers. This is also why you'll see a drop in profit during these months\n\nBut with new staff come new problems.\n\n**Lesson 3: Owning a business is more about managing the people than it is to drive sales.**\n\nNow this one is obvious but I never realized what a pain it can be to deal with your staff and/or customers. At the end of the day our staff makes you your money but oh my god can they be petty. It sometimes feels like I'm back in highschool the way they treat each other.\n\nWe've had situations where people just don't like and ignore the manager (one of the owners). Staff having arguments over accidentally bumping into each other, people \"Utusing\" each other to the point they weren't working anymore.\n\nIt's still something we're working on but I think a big part of it is how staff is handle by the manager. Nearly every month I hear issue about favoritism, show off, \"puro utos\", initially I thought people were just petty but it looks like it's a pattern. I think he lacks the people skills to be an effective leader but on the other hand I wouldn't want him to step down since he's the money maker at the salon, upselling and cross selling anyone he can accounting for probably 30% of our revenue,  he just lacks the management skills. It also doesn't help that everyone's related to each other working at the salon so things get personal sometimes.\n\n# So what's next?\n\nFor the salon we're looking to hit ₱1M/month, hopefully by November so we can repeat it in December. Metrics are looking really strong month-to-date to support scaling and hitting our ₱850K sales target for October.\n\nOne thing I want to figure out is how to send out mass texts similar to how Landers does it. I'm looking to transition our customer forms from pen and paper to an iPad where people can opt-in to receiving these messages (people have terrible handwriting lol).\n\nWe tried remarketing to existing customers manually through text and messenger, however it's not been as successful as I hope it would be. It was also extremely time consuming which is not something I wanted to push over to our admin. We're currently looking for a tool that lets your send mass texts like Landers or \"TheFreelanceMovementtribe\"(TFMT). I think we can hit our ₱1M a month goal if we have the right tools, so if anyone knows anything about this topic, hit me up!\n\nPersonally, I'm on the look out for businesses that are open to a marketing partner and are local to my area. I've started making offers here and there and I'm currently in the works of potentially buying into a beauty spa but I will keep you posted on that.",

Your main job now as entrepreneurs is to build a brand. A brand is not just a logo or tagline, it is a promise that you make to your customers. A brand makes them feel a certain way about your business. Since you're in a salon business, I think they should feel more beautiful after they walk out of your salon than when they went in. If you can consistently deliver on that, later on you will gain their loyalty and can command a better price. It is really hard for a business to fail if it can consistently delight its customers.\n\nAs to your people problem, you have to address it head on. Resentment and envy being part of the culture are dangerous. Talk to your people why they feel that there's favoritism. You might see it as something trivial, but those feelings always came from something that might be important to them. It's always better to be clear than clever when giving directions and expectations. Have a good incentives program to your people. Incentives are very powerful in aligning their interest to yours so think of it carefully and use it wisely.\n\nAnd lastly, hire slow, but fire fast. Having the right people that fits into the culture that you would want in your business will save you from a lot of headaches.",

So I have posted multiple times here for the purpose of seeing different perspective, opinions, and advices + also reading other threads.\n\nWith your comments I was able to get a more comfortable lifestyle in which sets me up to my plans.\n\n- 2 years ago, you guys taught me how to build an EF in which I have now\n\n- 2 Years ago you guys taught me about budgeting and keeping track of my expenses. (I’m a spreadsheet expert now jk)\n\n- 2 Years ago you guys made me realize that VUL is not worth it so I went for a whole life trad plan instead that I can just pay for 10-20 years.\n\n- 1 and a half Year Ago you guys taught me about cost averaging in stocks so I already have that right now monthly for US ETFs\n\n- 1 Year Ago, you guys gave me a better way to decide which career path should I take and have more growth and I have decided to take that.\n\n- 6 months ago you guys gave me a better perspective of my situation right now that I am okay despite feeling demotivated and left behind.\n\n- 2-4 months ago you guys gave me a solid decision to spend more for a comfortable place in which I am living right now. I never felt so motivated having a better home, fresh air, windows, great community for me and my pets. Still saving big even after this!\n\nJust wanted to say thank you to everyone. This community means a lot to me as I have no one to turn to for advices re finance and life decisions.\n\nOverall, I have a better income, a good investment, a better career, and a more comfortable and safe home. \n\nOne lesson I learned all throughout different advices regarding lifestyle?\n\nLiving frugally like really buying CHEAP THINGS just to save will make you spend more as your physical and mental health deteriorates.\n\nSpending more for a 10-20% for your comfort of living will save you from getting burnt from everything. It will keep you living FRUGALLY PROPERLY.\n\nI believe living frugally and living frugally properly are 2 diff things. The other one is like not buying medicine when you need it.\n\nIt varies from having your own place, getting better and healthy food, buying things that entertains you while you rest, or anything that can make you recharged with what you do from day to day\n\nI hope you guys continue to help out people like me.\n\nCheers to everyone!\n\n\nEDIT: Just adding because when I was living frugally in which NOT THE PROPER WAY; where I was demotivated and uninspired. I spent more money because I want to go on vacations frequently, spa, anything expensive that can distract me and feel like this can recharge me to work but then I realized going back to my actual lifestyle and home would just give that uninspired vibe back again. Now I spent more in my home for rent (Since I moved out) but I don’t have to go on vacations frequently or treat myself outside. My home is my safe space in which I can rest and relax! I got a better mattress, a better pillow etc. haha and I can swim downstairs and use the gym! Yay!\n\nSTILL PLANNING TO TRAVEL OFC! That’s a diff thing lol",

I bought a car, i rented my own place and I travelled once or twice a year out of the country.\n\nAlam mo it made my headspace clearer and mas magaan sa mental health ko. Di ako naniniwala sa delayed gratification ng ilang years, kasi tinry ko na and it is not for me. Ang bigat sa pakiramdam bawat araw that I needed to work tapos down na down yung mental health ko. Mas productive ako nung di ako nagdelayed gratification. Mas madami din savings ko at mas malaki nadadagdag sa EF ko kapag ganun hahahaha\n\nMy idea of living frugally is to spend what you can, di ko titipirin pero i make sure it is of good quality at pangmatagalan ko gagamitin. That way, i don't have to palit yearly ng gamit, maybe 5 years yeah. So kung may low quality at highest quality, kapag mas malaki ang lamang ng high quality at a comfortable price i go for it. Pero kung may mid price that will satisfy what i need, dun ako mostly. Never the cheap ones na di mo subok ang tibay kasi di mo sure baka next year need na naman bumili ng bago. I don't buy way above my means, lalo na kung di kailangan. I cook my own food (ang laking tipid nito) tsaka kung may travel coming up mas iniistretch ko yung pwedeng gawing pagkain na galing ref. Kung may extra aside sa net kong income and savings, half lang nun ang allowed kong gastusin (pero dahil nga wala ako masyadong guilty pleasure o gustong bilhin dahil nga di naman down ang mental health ko, i end up not even using most of it so napupunta siya sa savings sa travel). \n\nAyun, i end up saving 50% of my income kahit may lifestyle inflation na at may gusto akong bilhin vs nagdelayed gratification ako tapos 30% lang nagiging savings ko. But this is just me.\n\nPS.\nIsa pang tip ko, lagi ko pinapalabas na wala akong pera para di ako utangan hahahahaha di narin ako masyado nagsosoc med masyado para di ako imessage ni mars hahahahahaha",

The post was Be Pragmatic, so I gave some pragmatic advice, which almost anyone to some degree can follow. I'm not a financial expert and not trying beating inflation, but maybe it can help.\n\nIt seems some people want more radical solutions. Here's what worked for us. Your situation may differ, and this may or may not work for you.\n\n1) Never apply for jobs that are too far from home. Apply for work within your town and city. Better, work from home. An alternative is to apply for work that has housing.\n\n2) Avoid red meat. Eat grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, and chicken. If your workplace offers lunch and dinner, eat more at work, and fast at home.\n\n3) Avoid marrying and having children early. Save first, then marry and have children later, or not at all.\n\n4) Never get a credit card. If you have a credit card, always pay your credit card balance in full.\n\n5) Avoid debt. If you cannot pay something in full or in cash, do not buy it. You cannot afford it.\n\n6) Build or increase your emergency fund. If your fund can support 3-6 months of no work, build it to support 6-12 months.\n\nA lot of my advice is to avoid costs in the long run. It's what I call defensive living.\n\nI'm not sure what advice to give someone who risked a lot, such as getting married and having children early, acquiring debt for their business, etc. Maybe the advice for them is to focus on building their business and their family so they can be productive. Maybe instead of defensive living, they can try offensive living and seek as many opportunities as they can. All the best!",

The tips are the goal and how you get there is up to you.\n\n1. Increase Your Income\n\nI also had a 9 to 5 job before and was earning 13K a month (WTF). I wake up at 6AM then come home at 8PM. I can't possibly have time to do another hustle, Diba? So ung ginawa ko, nag resign ako and applied sa BPO. My working hour then became from 4AM to 1PM!! NOOOOWWWWW Meron na akong oras from 2PM onwards to do side hustle (Plus I earn more on my day job) Ayos! 2 birds with one stone.\n\nNung tumaas na ung income ko, nakaipon ng onti, I found an opportunity! May nakita ako na fully furnished condo na worth 15k/month. I decided to rent it and list it sa Airbnb. Hired a part-time HRM student and I'm paying her P500/guest to clean my unit. Nakatulong na ako sa student, MORE INCOME PA without me wasting time. That unit is earning positive ROI para sakin. This, plus my side hustle (web design) SHIT! MORE INCOME ULIT!!\n\n2. Track Your Expenses and Reduce Expenses\n\nSimula nung tumaas income ko dahil sa side hustles ko, mas naging applicable na ung dalawang tips na to. Hindi porket tumaas na ung income eh I have to increase my lifestyle as well. Madaling sabihin diba? Pero eto ung pinakamahirap gawin!! Kasi kahit na gaano kataas ung income mo, pero tumataas din expenses mo eh bali wala lng din. So, Increase your income while maintaining your lifestyle (taas mo ng konti para maging comfortable lifestyle naman)\n\nOne thing I also noticed when tracking expenses is makikita mo ung mga tiny purchases na hindi naman kailangan. In my case are (Spotify subscription, Lotto tickets, Special sa pag sakay ng tike (walking is healthy anyway), buying coffees (I now brew my own coffee, mas mura pala sya), street foods, and more. So, tinangal ko na. I can live without it.\n\nI was also become aware of my spending habbits. I spend more sa mga bagay that earns me money (Investing is beating inflation) pero right now, more on mutual funds ako (wala na akong time to do market research, kaya perfect ang mutual funds) OH SHIT, More income ulit without wasting too much time!!!.\n\nSo,\n\nIt may seem common sense, yes, pero paano mo gawin un requires creativity. Always look out for opportunities. The system is NOT DESIGNED to keep you at the bottom. Kasi if it is, edi sana we don't hear about people na \"rags to riches diba\"?\n\nAlso beating the inflation was meant sa savings mo sa bank or paper money na hawak mo. It would be better to invest them.\n\nThese guys meant no harm, yes, totoo but this post will harm more Filipino.\n\nStaying resilient is bad if you have the capacity to act.",

    "body": "✅Upto 100% of what you pay for your VULs in the first year goes to the sales force. This means that instead of your money earning interest, your money goes to the commission of your sales agent, their managers, and whoeverelse are on top. To validate this, you may check your policy booklet /quotation. You'll notice that nothing goes to your investment. For some plans with higher monthly premiums, they put a small amount in the first year few years, and not zero. For most plans, the commission payment only stops on the 5th year.\n\n✅They get commission from your monthly payment for Upto 5yrs for certain types of plans. For some plans with higher premiums, this may be shorter. So your money isn't growing, they use it to fund their luxurious out of the country escapades.\n\n✅In the event that you cancel your plan in the first few years, you won't be able to get the full amount of your fund value. They'll deduct a huge portion for not finishing the period of payment.\n\n✅Many agents do not actually know what they are selling you. They are selling insurance but they are made to believe that they are helping their clients prepare for retirement or prepare for their children's college education. Why on earth would you buy a life insurance plan for your child's college education? \n\n✅Agents are trained to respond to your objections. If you want to stay away from FAs, just stick with a plain and simple NO. If they probe further, say that they are making you uncomfortable and change the topic. If they still insist after this, then I think you know better than entertain them.\n\n✅To the sales agents of Prulife, especially the Alexandrite district in Makati, they'll make you sign a document that you have to resign of you don't hit your quota. Not all branches do this, but this particular district (what they call their sales group in a particular location) is greedy and evil. Since you may still receive your sales commission from the company even after you don't hit the quota set by the branch, the branch will pressure you to submit your resignation letter. This will ensure that all your future commission will be forfeited in favor of your managers. So to all the FAs of Alexandrite branch, do not sign this document. Do not resign when you don't hit the quota. You deserve all the commission from the sales that you made, not your managers.\n\n✅If you really need life insurance, get a term insurance which is very cheap, and invest the bulk of your money in other investment vehicles like Pag-ibig MP2, REITs, or PERA. All of these can be automated for convenience. This way, you'll be saving A LOT of money.",

    "body": "My name isn’t important, and this is a throwaway account for security and privacy reasons. I consider myself an amateur researcher/scientist with a passion for cooking, baking, and inventing stuff. At best, a poet; at worst, an artist. During the pandemic, with nothing better to do at home, I dedicated my energy to my love for ice cream—Filipino Sorbetes, Western Custard Ice Cream, Turkish Kulfi, Sorbets, Soft Serve, Popsicles, Mochi. If it’s ice cream, I’ve made it. Any flavor? No problem. Any dietary restrictions? How about a lactose free, sugar free alternative? Any food you want turned into ice cream? Done. I made bamboo-flavored ice cream—possibly a first here and abroad. Black Charcoal sorbetes? I’m proud to say I’m the first in the Philippines to have made it using lab-tested, food-grade activated charcoal.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I realized there was a massive market for good commercial ice cream. Not high-end, gourmet, expensive stuff mind you, but ice cream that’s better than the junk that Nestlé and Selecta peddle to the masses. Ever wonder why their ice cream feels slimy, gummy, and bland to eat? That’s because they’re skimping on ingredients and feeding you air and lies. But there is a massive goldmine just waiting to be tapped with dirty ice cream I'm surprised no one has capitalized on yet. Simply because my recipe uses better and cleaner techniques and ingredients to achieve a higher profit margin than competitors.\n\nWith that knowledge, I started an ice cream business and found early success. I also managed to develop an entirely new type of Filipino ice cream—one that combines Western technology with Filipino techniques, has a higher profit margin than common ice creams in the market, and offers a better flavor selection. However, I soon realized that I’m not cut out for business. I’m too kind. Too forgiving. I was blindsided by unreliable partners, betrayed by friends who wanted my recipe, and ultimately lost the company I started. And worst of all, I failed to get any major contracts signed. (Please don't berate me on this massive mistake, I already suffered enough).\n\nBack when the popular ice cream vendor in Davao, Mang Danny, was still alive, he was offered 6M for his recipe. He didn’t sell, of course; who would in their right mind? Well, I’m in a rough spot right now. I haven’t made good ice cream in weeks due to the stress of dealing with business partners and their bullshit. And I realized that I just wanted to make ice cream, so that’s right, I’m selling...\n\nIf any mods want to delete this post if it breaks the rules, please proceed. But otherwise, I can provide credentials and name the company that I started (Yes, the company is doing great, flourishing even, just not what I had envisioned my ice cream, my baby, to be).\n\nI can also name the congressman who commissioned that bamboo ice cream and provide pics for that event. \\*That’s a massive hint right there of who I am. \\*\\*And the lab tests and certificates of our activated charcoal\n\nSo yes, if you’re interested in taking the recipe off my hands, please do. So far, it’s only given me heartbreak. I'd prefer it if I could have my friends and people I consider to be my family back. But I guess money is more important to them than relationships...\n\nThe recipe is, as the younger kids say nowadays, simply designed and built different. Meaning, other competitor's ice cream just won't be able to compete as efficiently due to the basic nature of what the recipe is and isn't. What’s more, it’s versatile enough to expand beyond traditional scoops. This could include premium packaged pints, artisan popsicles, or even a high-demand catering line.\n\nI don't like to kick other competitors when they are down, and I think they can still improve, but MyChoice Ice Cream uses bad coconut oil that makes their ice cream horrible. **So to try to summarize a TLDR; I am selling the secret recipe, the techniques, business insights and knowledge, a business plan similar to My Choice's, and my expertise..**\n\nFor any more questions, or if you would like to request the detailed business plan, please ask me anything you like in the comments or send a DM. If you think this is a scam, send a DM, and I'll make you an ice cream pint if you're in my area.\n\nIt's nearing December and I just need a new life and a break..\n\nEDIT: Thank you to the people who gave me the time of day to talk, give advice or even just offer kind words! I'm a long time lurker on Reddit, but I'm new to replying here so I might not be able to respond. But please, send me a DM so I can email you, I reply there faster...",

Its part of the crazy world of FMCG and the pain points you mentioned are things our company faces as well. Ice cream just isnt a must buy commodity for our third world country. Its a treat, usually for celebrations. This is why ice cream tubs do so well here. People save their hard earned money to buy them and eat with family. \n\nIn my opinion for your company to be a true disruptor is if you can price your product as one of the cheapest and still have superior quality. These big companies are investing more into creating “value for money” ice cream lines. Meaning lower quality but more affordable due to the rising costs of raw materials and other factors like inflation.\n\nOn the distribution side naman you need to decide whether you will plan on buying freezers to be rented by retailers OR just have them store it in freezers themselves. Both of which are very hard to do especially if alam mo ugali ng mga pinoy. (Naglalagay ng tocino and other products sa freezer kahit na bawal)\n\n\nTldr; ice cream is not a hot commodity and has a very intricate business model, It in itself is hard to penetrate without large capital and proper business model (freezer management and expansion plans)",

I started as the secretary, cleaner, book keeper, marketing and professional service provider.\n\nI started 2015, its been 9 years now ( wow, time flies). At 1st i did well, then i met a business partner who wanted to help me expand, he gave me capital which at that time i thought i needed. But i was unprepared and when pandemic hit, i did a reset. im repaying the capital my partner invested and now im back to being the owner working with my wife.\nIt helps to have a trustworthy life partner, but if you dont have one dont rush it. Now my business is run by my wife and i plus a secretary, and guess what? we didnt really need to expand the business as of yet.\n\nWe run the business from the bottom up, always thinking of quality before quantity. A lesson learned and much aprreciated now. The secret recipe for our success is the quality, which from your post i think you have.\n\nYou have your niche, you know the numbers. All you need is a reset. And go back to the reason why you started in the 1st place- to give good quality and affordable healthy food (God knows we all need it). If your reason for starting doesn't rhyme with you anymore, then please surrender qith peace in your heart. But if your reason still kindles a spark, please do go on.\n\nI think your only mistake was trying to gain so much too fast too soon. Slow down a bit and have patience. After 9 years I realized its what i just needed. The expansion will come all in due time. You'll know it, cos when it does come, it will fill you with excitement and not dread, contentment and not pleasure.\n\nGood luck OP, padayun and Godspeed.",

        "body": "I also nerded out on ice cream during the pandemic. I had first made ice cream following my Philips ice cream makers recipes 14 years ago, but idk, during the lockdowns I felt inspired to make ice cream. I managed to get my hands on a lot of different emulsifiers, stabilizers, sugars. I tried lots of different creams and milks. I figured out fat/sugar/milk solids/ water ratios for different fruits, nuts, liquors, etc. I successfully made sorbet, gelato, frozen custard, sorbetes (the coconut milk and cassava starch style), American and french style ice cream. I got to make sugar free and dairy free ice cream as well. I got Brix testers, 2 batch freezers, a pasteurizer, and almost bought a blast freezer. It was damn good. The only thing I struggled with was swirls and inclusions. I personally delivered small batches of ice cream around the Greater Manila area for the few months I was selling.\n\n\nNot a lot of people were not willing to pay a premium for an all-natural ice cream with natural stabilizers/emulsifiers, with very low overrun. People were even scared by the science. They hear scientific terms and processes and correlate it to being artificial or full of chemicals. I should have just kept my mouth shut about that part, tbh.\n\nI also experimented with using chemicals, of course. Being able to keep ice cream ice free and scoop able right out of the freezer after 2 weeks, with just one tiny little extra ingredient was really scary.\n\nI saw, from my experience in other businesses and from trying for a while, that it was not something that I could scale up while maintaining the same level of quality. Ultimately not because of the ingredients or costs, or labor or logistics. People! People suck. I could not scale up without someone trying to get the recipes or take away control for some important steps of the process. I was being asked to make compromises or switch to cheaper ingredients. \n\n I make ice cream for friends and family, on small equipment, having sold almost all the big stuff. \n\nI hope to work with chefs one day to make really good ice cream for restaurants though. Something that doesn't have to be stored for long. I hope you don't lose your passion for ice cream! But I'll admit I lost mine and it's not really back yet. I don't even eat ice cream when I'm on vacation, and I used to purposefully visit ice cream shops for that purpose.",

    "body": "Cost of living is extremely high, relatively, yet people's income is ridiculously low. Think about it...the cheapest meal you can get in Manila at a back alley, hole in the wall joint is 70 piso (e.g. Tapsilog...a child's fist sized plain white rice with 2 fingers worth of the cheapest meat the vendor could get)...but minimum wage, which the majority of the workforce is on, is 600 a day. \n\nSo a single portion of the cheapest food you could get is 11% of your day's wage. And you don't even get a drink with that! Add a drink and it's now 15%. Add another person...like a dependant and now we're at 30%...! You and your loved one at one nutrition-deprived meal that barley filled you up and %30 of your wage is gone! Absolutely crazy!\n\nGrocery is actually more expensive here than in a lot of developed countries...US...Canada...etc., even produce. For example the laundry detergent like Ariel that you get here for 87 piso for a pack of 6 is actually 51 piso ($0.91) in the US. So it's 70% more expensive here, yet people make 70% less!\n\nElectricity is also more expensive. And then there is rent - an even bigger mind boggle. The rent here is criminally high. That's why Filipino's are destined to always be packed like sardines 10 deep in a coffin of a room wherever you go. \"Bed spacer\" signs everywhere...visuals of bunkbeds through windows, like everyone is living in a prison cell, or never made it out of their childhood bed. That's the norm, when it shouldn't be! Which other South East Asians (or even Asians in general) live that way at this rate??\n\nBut wait a min! At least they got beds, and roofs. No other Asian country has more homeless people than the Philippines (except India maybe, but they are literally the most populous country in the world. 1.8 million Indians are homeless. But there are almost 1.5 BILLION Indians...so literally 0.1% of the population. I wonder what the stats of the Philippines wound be.). \n\nThailand has much better infrastructure and quality of practically everything...from produce, to housing to healthcare, and yet it is significantly cheaper. Even Singapore that's one of the most expensive places in the world, it's cheaper to eat out there than it is here, and for food that is much better! It's crazy! It's like the Philippines is in a perpetual inflation. Why though? \n\nThoughts.",

Lalo na sa time ng parents natin na wlaa pa masyadong CI at medical insurance forced talaga sila mag out of pocket.\n\nAside from this, isang issue din na nakikita ko sa pinoy is lack of prioritization sa health.\n\nSabi nga nila you can have 1000 problems today but when you face a health problem that's the only problem that matters.\n\nPeople should be more intentional in what they eat, exercise and regular executive check ups. Very typical kasi sa atin ang \"hindi ako magpapa check up kasi baka may makitang sakit\". \nAnd kung may sakit na we often just want to treat symptoms rather than prevent the illness (lalo na if lifestyle illnesses) \n\nMaiiwasan ang gulatan if early palang you have data ka na sa health mo.\n\nI'm not saying this is a perfect approach e.g. Cancer can sometimes just come out of the blue lalo na if rare form of cancer but at least we do our part early on. \n\nIto talaga biggest fear ko sa parents namin ng wife ko yung critical illness that could wipe away all our savings. Di na kasi sila insurable. \n\nShare ko lang din yung mama ng wife ko had cancer pero very early stages, we approached a government hospital for the surgery with the help of our doctor friend, sugery was free but we had to pay s mga meds n di available sa hospital we shelled out around 30k. Scheduling was tough thoufh na pupushback kasi di urgent care yung surgery ni mama, from original sched of may naging june but it was fine. We understood na may mas life threatening na dapat maunsa or maisingit. \n\nButi nlng early detection,  now may lifetime maintenance lng siya na oral meds for the cancer. Also upon last check wala n daw trace sa cancer. We hope that the cancer does not come back. \n\nWe also had a talk sa wife ko, should i have a terminal illness, i wouldn't want to sacrifice my quality of life by spending the last few months in a hospital bed and jeopardizing her future in the process.",

Ang laki talaga ng difference ng charges ng high-end hospitals from others. Not even talking about the facilities or professional fees kasi reasonable naman yun. Consumables or lab tests palang ang mahal na, imagine same na gamot (same brand, same dosage) or same na medical consumable (e.g. gauze or cannula) can be priced 50-100% more of cost charged by public or smaller name private hospital. These consumables or tests add up, lalo kung confined ng matagal at maraming procedure.\n\n Agree sa other comments that marami namang public facilities na okay (remember, more patients, mas praktisado mga doctor) and cost effective. UP PGH and DOH tertiary hospitals, but also pwede rin may doctor kang gusto pero sa iba magpa confine or sa iba magpa-lab test.\n\nKaya for me shop around sa hospitals, ask for second opinions, and equip yourself with information. Talk to doctor friends if you have them and ask ano yung mga necessary lang gawin at anong mga long term scenarios. Sometimes palliative or end of life care should also be considered, so you can have your family comfortable at home while spending time with them w/o the business and cold hospital rooms. May pagkamahal din yun pero at least di ka na aasa and magbabayad sa tests or inpatient care na mahal.\n\nWhile we want to give our families the best care for their illness, expensive health care is not always the best care.",

    "body": "Hi! I’m Reddit Thriver! 25 years old. 20k/month. Bpo. College dropout.\n\nMy goal is to earn a million (or more) in 5 years so i could migrate to Canada. I am already what you would consider an “ulila”. Lost my parent 10 years ago and i have no other siblings. Only daughter. I’m on my own. One property left where i stay now rent-free, and monetary inheritance were eventually left at zero. Over the years, instead of investing on my future i worked on my mental health. Bought a ton of material possessions to satisfy my emptiness. I honestly didn’t want to live any further. I was just waiting to die because what’s it like to live when you’re all alone? Now i just really want to work on my dream.\n\nMy first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/n6gaqz/i_can_do_this_right/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nI know this is a long read but i just really wanted to let this out and give you some little progress. Ganito pala pakiramdam na every cut off, naeexcite ka magbudget. One thing that hyped me (apart from the encouragement from various awesome, AWESOME redditors) were spreadsheets! Grabe. It made it 10x even more motivating!!! My fixed biweekly rate is around 9k+ pesos every cutoff (inclusive of the tax, contribution and night diff) - i only get more if may bonuses, double pay or incentives. As you can see my salary isn’t that high, i hopped bpo jobs before to the point where employers would reject me because of my portfolio. I sucked up and changed my career decisions and now i’ve been with my current company for 3 years (again, another achievement i’m also proud of!)\n\nCelebrating my baby steps in this subreddit! Barya lang ‘to sainyo, for sure. But it’s the thriving that gives me that kind of high. It’s like i found a will to live again that’s worth celebrating. Haha. In a month:\n- wow natuto akong mag-monitor ng expenses ko, up to the last cent! 😳 this was something i have never pictured myself doing!\n- i got me a housemate! hati kami sa lahat ng bills - meralco, water, grocery (laking tipid pag may ka-ambag ka sa budget unlike pag wala!)\n- opened an account with Komo! (500/payday muna sayang mataas din interest)\n- i got monetary gifts from relatives from my 25th bday and i opened a passbook savings acc with Metrobank (no atm) and part of it, i immediately saved to my EF. my short term goal is to finish off at 60k-100k by dec2020! let’s start with that\n- 50 pesos on GInvest/payday, i’m now on my 2nd streak (yung 3 local funds pa lang hehe) - i plan to do this long term too, will put more once i increase my income.\n- since wala pa akong mahanap na part time in the morning (VA..etc) - i took 4hrs/ot for 2 weeks with my current job. taking advantage of the on top 300/hr. 12 hrs of work per day but, hey! napakalaking bagay — that’s almost 10k din. if tuloy tuloy ang need for OT, i will definitely volunteer again! \n- i also volunteered for some admin work (month end) for a day in the office. 2k on top of the paid day. again, NAPAKALAKING bagay. dati ang 2k sa akin, pang-eat out or shopping na. now, wow it’s a different kind of appreciation!\n- i made a col account! and still doing some diligent research about the stock market [and crypto also!]. once done with my ef, and i’m emotionally and mentally ready, saka ako sasabak\n- then the regular CIMB EF: 10k 💪, MP2 - 6k, Komo - 1k, Metrobank: 10k [on my prev post, zero and 1k lang sila. But in a month i have already saved 27k! 😍 - and more once i get my ot incentive by next month. It’s the little kilig i get that i did it!]\n\n\n3% progress! One step at a time!\n\n\nTLDR; At 25, i constantly contemplate on my past money mistakes. 7 years working, not a single peso in my bank account, zero investments until last month! Nagbago ang ihip ng hangin. I realized there’s no point in regretting the past kasi it’s all gone. It doesn’t matter kasi what’s done is done, what’s important is what i know now. I know better, and still thrive to learn more as i go, i start, save, work smart, be consistent and carry on. Kaya shocks, sobrang thank you! Had i not bumped into this subreddit, mananatili akong mangmang with my finances. Indeed educating myself thru this sub was the way! Thank you r/phinvest and redditors!! This is just a portion of my progress. I plan to post here again, once I achieve my first milestone: accomplished EF!! Claiming it 💛",

About migrating to Canada: My advice is to go back to college / university as soon as you have enough savings and have a degree that's in demand in Canada. That will help you when you decide to apply for Canada PR. It doesn't really matter which school you choose as the goal is to have a degree. Then strive to be the best at what you do. That way, you won't have any problem landing a job when you arrive in Canada. Best of luck.",

    "body": "Madalas ka makakabasa ng mga redditors na earning 6 digits a month with so many assets. Para sa average wage earner, nakakainspire siya at the same time nakakapanlumo. \n\nKung isa ka dun, di ka nag-iisa. I'm one of those na 5 digit earners. Hindi sobrang taas pero may natitira din. I have investments pero maliit lang. For benchmark, nasa 6k pesos ang annual dividend earnings ko. Medyo mababa pero that's okay. I'm currently buying stocks pag pumapasok yung mga dividends sa account ko para unti unting mapataas ang earnings. \n\nI currently have no hope na mag-earn ng 6 digits with my job kasi okay na ko sa current position ko. It gives me a good enough salary for my needs at the same time enough free time para di mabaliw at para magawa lahat ng hobbies ko. I have no dependents and no plans of having a child. \n\nSome will say na I should hustle since bata pa ko pero preferred ko talaga ang slow life. Factor na din when my friend died so young. Napaisip ako, full speed nga ako sa pagkita, what if madeads ako bigla? I will have so many regrets.\n\nSo what I do is balance self love with financial stability. Because not worrying about money is a form of self love. Mas maliit man ang nalalagay mo sa investments, at least meron. Makakagastos ka ng bukal sa loob mo dahil habang nagsasaya ka, kumikita ka pa rin, di nga lang ganun kalaki.\n\nWag ka mapressure. You do you.",

    "body": "Recently napansin ko maraming nag tatanong about starting a bussiness while still working at their full time job. I would like to share my experience kasi baka makatulong sa iba or mabigyan kayo ng idea.\n\nI currently work full time sa office and make around 40k a month. I don't spend on things that I don't need and rarely eat out. I still go out once a month and still buy things that I want from time to time but the majority of my money is saved or invested. Now I have 2 other sources of income that give me around 400k a year passively with little to no effort. Here's what I did these past 4 years.\n\n1.I paid all my debt on my first year of work. It doesn't matter if di masarap ang pagkain or walang bagong damit as long as zero debt by the end of the year\n\n2.I listed all my expenses for the month and identified the biggest expense and tried to reduce it. I also stopped spending on things I didnt need. Rarely used subscriptions will make you bleed money. I stopped drinking coffee outside kasi I realized na I was spending 500 a week on stupidly expensive coffee.\n\n3.I saved 80% of my net income (after expenses) for a year habang nag aaral ako kung saan ko pwede ilagay yung pera ko. base sa previous blunders ko, investments made in haste always go to waste (4 years ago I wasted my 100k life savings on a get rich quick investmet, never again), aral muna bago invest.\n\n4.I invested money on stock na may dividends at nagset ako ng monthly investment plan. yung second year ko sa work, I followed my monthly investment plan and was able to get around 50k in dividends. when the stock market fell down during covid (2020) at nung russian invasion of Ukraine (2022) I went all in sa mga stocks na gusto ko kasi based sa assesment ko tataas uli yung mga yun. I was correct. I saved all my earning there.\n\n5.I asked my family members and friends na walang work to help find people na pwedeng mag alaga ng live stock. After 6 or more months ng paghahanap, we were able to find trustworthy people na mag aalaga ng baboy at baka. We split the earnings in half with the caretakers. My family and friends would manage it for me for 10% of my net income tapos all I had to do was check on them once a month. I get around 20-35% net income from these bussinesses per sale depende sa live weight price.\n\nAfter 4 years of saving and investing di parin ako nag quit sa dead end work ko pero now I don't stress out sa work. I don't grind anymore and I just do what is asked of me. I don't work for a promotion anymore and just take it slow everyday pero weirdly enough na promote ako last year so salamat parin I guess. The money I earn isn't big pero the peace of mind it gives is really wonderful. I don't render overtime anymore sa work and just go home at 5pm para mag laro sa PC ko or mag gym. I hope you guys pickup something from this. Have fun investing and good luck!",

Please don't get offended.\n\nIncome: 40k a month (I assume it's a take home pay, or net)\n\n**First year:** No passive income as you are paying all your debts **all year round**\n\n**Second year:** Saved 80% of your income for **a year**. 40k \\* .8 = 32k \\* 12 = 384,000\n\n\\#4 is kinda vague, you said you saved on your second year (#3), but then you said you're investing it on monthly basis (plan). You also said that during this year kumita ka ng 50k in dividends. So that's 13% yield of 384k. But that's hypothetical for now since on the second year, you're saving while investing? I don't know what percentage goes to saving, and to investing.\n\n**Third year until mid-year:** Kakahanap mo palang ng caretaker, so the setup and other things to do I'd assume at least a month. Let's assume na binenta mo yung share from dividend na 50k, ang puhunan sa livestock for pig is 8k per head until maibenta. Ang cow naman around 30-40 per head ang pang alaga. So I don't know how a 50k would suffice unless you stopped investing in stocks at this point. Mejo magulo sa part na to since maghahati pa kayo sa kita ng caretaker, then less 10% sa hati mo pa. Let's say 10 heads nalang, ang puhunan jan ay \\~8k per head. Live weight is 180pesos per kilo, and 80kgs yung baboy. So ang net is \\~6.5k times 10 heads = 65k, divide by 2 (caretaker) = 37.7k, less 10% = **\\~34k (net for 10 heads)**.\n\nAng baka naman, matagal ang harvest so wala ka pa kita dito.\n\n**Fourth year:** Unless nagdagdag ka ng head ng baboy, let say 20 heads. You only have 68k net \\* 2 harvest per year = 136k. Assuming walang namatay sa pigs at assuming nagdagdag ka ng pig heads. And assuming din na walang ASF during that time.\n\n136k (livestock) + 50k (dividend) = less than 200k. And the 136k isn't a passive income here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I don't know how did you come up with 400k *passive* income after 4 years.\n\nSorry, I'm not buying this, OP. Good if you did.",

So what you live with your parents rent free who pay for your food, utilities and necessities? Even if all your meals are canned goods and siomai from Ministop sorry 7k ain't enough to live in PH.\n\nI mean if we can all live off our parents then we already have passive income. It's then very easy to take all that money and put it somewhere where it will gain money.",

So madami talagang tao. \n\nThen kinabukasan nagemail sakin. Disapproved yung site. It’s inside a grocery store. Madami din stalls inside. With average sales of 8k per day yung mga unknown brands competitors. Sabi nila mas maganda daw kasi outside. Their exact words are “this is disapproved as the best location is outside *name of the grocery store*. Mind you, outside of the store cannot be rented. Idk. Feels off lang. Meaning ba nun porket may mas magandang lugar ( na di pwedeng irent), disapproved na yung location inside na maganda din naman?

Do NOT take out a loan to try to pay for their loan. You will ruin your credit score on top of theirs. It’s not a smart decision. You need to keep your credit okay so that you have more options in the future in case of certain emergencies (like what if one of your parents has a health emergency and you’re short and di ka Maka-loan for their hospital bills because you destroyed your credit trying to help them pay their cc debt?).

        "body": "First of all, I want to acknowledge the heavy burden you’re carrying as a young breadwinner, especially in such a challenging financial situation. It’s not easy, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. Here’s a strategy that might help:\n\n1. Avalanche Method\n\n•Your plan to use the avalanche method is a sound one. It focuses on paying off debts with the highest interest rates first, which saves you money on interest over time. Since you’re pre-qualified for a bank loan with a 1.5% interest rate, consider using it to pay off one of the higher-interest debts, like the active credit cards. This could significantly reduce the interest you’re paying.\n\n2. Consolidation\n\n•If you can find a way to consolidate the credit card debts (for example, by transferring balances to a card with a lower interest rate or taking out a lower-interest personal loan), this could simplify your payments and reduce interest. However, be careful to check for any fees or penalties associated with transferring balances.\n\n3. Emergency Fund\n\n•You’ve already built up a ₱150k emergency fund, which is excellent. I would recommend keeping this intact for true emergencies. In your situation, you don’t want to deplete your safety net.\n\n4. Cutting Expenses and Increasing Income\n\n•Look at your current expenses to see if there are any areas where you can cut back, even temporarily. This will free up more money to put toward debt repayment.\n•Consider if there are ways to increase your income, even if it’s through part-time work, side gigs, or using your skills in the healthcare field for freelance opportunities.\n\n5. Negotiate with Creditors\n\n•Sometimes creditors are willing to negotiate lower interest rates or extended payment terms, especially if they know you’re struggling. It’s worth calling and explaining your situation to see if they can offer any relief.\n\n6. Involve Your Parents\n\n•Your parents should be involved in this process, even if they have limited income. They need to understand the gravity of the situation and contribute where they can, even if it’s a small amount. Additionally, this might be a good time for them to learn more about managing finances to avoid repeating these mistakes.\n\n7. Mental Health\n\n•The stress of being a breadwinner and handling significant debt can take a toll on your mental health. Don’t hesitate to reach out for support from friends, family, or even professional counseling. Sometimes just talking through your situation can help relieve some of the burden.\n\n8. Education for Sibling\n\n•As the eldest, you might feel the pressure to support your sibling’s education. If possible, explore scholarships, grants, or financial aid that your sibling can apply for to help lessen the financial load on you.\n\n9. Long-term Plan\n\n•It’s important to create a long-term financial plan once the debts are under control. This should include building up savings, starting investments, and securing insurance. It may feel distant now, but having a plan can give you hope for the future.\n\nThis is a tough spot to be in, but taking it one step at a time can make it more manageable. Focus on small victories and take care of your well-being throughout this process. You’re already doing an incredible job under immense pressure.",

It really hit me that I am adult at that point and was questioning why I'm the one doing this when I'm the bunso.\n\nIt's important to tackle them one by one. You have 1 year to file for Estate Tax, do the other \"easy stuff\" first.\n\nPART 1\n1. Publish the death in a newspaper's obituary section. The half newspaper, almost tabloid layout will be cheaper.\n2. List down all properties - real properties (lots, H&L, commercial building) and personal properties (car, bank account, stocks, etc). Decide what you want to do with them, keep yourself or sell. This will be later on written on the affidavit.\n3. If you know that atm pin or mobile banking passwords, withdraw or transfer that money to your account. Notify the bank regarding the death only after you've emptid the account. Else, this will be freezed and subject to Estate Tax.\n4. If you don't know the pin or password, you can actually get the money and just ask for the bank for the form that allows them to deduct the tax from whatever you'll withdraw. There are other requirements as well which I cant recall now.\n5. If your parents have insurances, get them next. This is the easiest to claim, usually just need to fill up a form and give cooy of Death Cert. With SunLife, 1 week processing only.\n6. Good news if you got the bank and insurance money, you may have enough to pay for the expenses\n\nPART 2 (remember you have 1 year to file, no need to rush)\n7. Get a lawyer. Present the list of properties you made and make sure to bring all titles so that they can type up exact land description. Important: Tell the lawyer to make Affidavit for EACH property. I made the mistake of making just 1 deed for all properties so I had to wait till the other released the stamped deed to process another property.\n\nAll properties you decide to keep = Affidavit of Self Adjudication / Properties you decide to sell = Affidavit of Self Adjusication with Absolute Sale\n\nIf you did Step 2, you don't need to include it in the list of properties.\n\n8. Have affidavit notarized and published in a newspaper. Make sure to keep the newspaper and have multiple copies if you have a lot of properties.\n9. Get list of requirements to for estate tax filing and go to BIR to settle Estate Tax. Keep all receipts and the Certificate of Payment of Estate Tax.\n\nPART 3 (this doesn't need to be done in a year, only part 2 is part of the 1 year deadline)\n10. For the properties you decide to keep, you have to go to each city/province's Real Property department and fulfill requirements for transfer to your name.\n11. Wait for release of the new titles under your name.\n12. For properties you decide to sell, you don't need to transfer proprty to your name. That's what the Ansolute Sale part is for. If property was paid in cash, give the buyer the title and certified true copy of the Certificate of Payment of Estate Tax, keep the original. Let them manage the name transfer. If not paid in cash, only facilitate the name transfer after payment.\n13. With the car, process is same with real properties basically but with LTO.\n\nI hope this helps!! Some might not be as straightforward depending on the properties tou're dealing with but I'm sure you'll figure it out.\n\nIt's really very overwhelming but take it one step at a time and give yourself time to grieve.",

Bank accounts too, but if you have access to these through mobile apps/ATM cards, you should empty it yourself and not mention it anymore.\n2. Then have it notarized. The moment you do this, the 60 day deadline for paying LGU transfer taxes starts. If you're near the deadline already, you can go straight to step 5 and ask if they can compute it for you so you don't have to pay penalties. Edit: Some LGUs will use the date of death as the start of the 60 day deadline.\n3. Have the deed publicized. I used BULGAR newpaper. You can go straight to next step before this is complete.\n4. Pay the estate tax with BIR RDO where her registered address is. Do this within 1 year of death date. You'll need copies of all the property titles and tax declarations, stock certificates and vehicle registration and insurance papers (if any). Bring copy of their last credit card bill and other bills or receipts related to their death, you can use these as deductible. Also a barangay certificate stating their main address (if property is owned) since it is also deductible.\n5. Go to LGU city/municipal hall of each property and have the transfer tax computed and paid.\n6. Go to Registry of Deeds of each property and have the title transferred to you.\n7. Go back to LGU city/municipal hall assessor's office and transfer the tax declarations to your name after you get the new titles.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have questions pa.

This is a lot to deal with, and the fallout of losing your loved ones and trying to sort out what they owned will take time to process. Likely years. It's important to embrace that fact, and accept that consolidation and selling are time-consuming, and a process- but one that is yours now. \n\nSometimes we find ourselves in places like these.

    "body": "Many people who knew me would say that I am a convenient and quite the \"realist\" type, who always chooses what works best in every situation, regardless of what his heart tells him to do.\n\nI am pretty new in the sub, mostly commenting here and there, but I never drafted my post. Lately, however, I have noticed a HUGE DIVIDE going on between people sharing their stories. People who graduated from top academic institutions versus those who came from \"universities, not on the list\" type, those working in high-paying jobs versus those who are working odd-jobs to get by, those who send their siblings to school versus someone who spends their money primarily for food deliveries, and those who feel stuck in their low-paying jobs versus those who have every opportunity within their reach.\n\nSo I hope that sharing my experience would help bridge that gap by a little. Before we delve into the discussion, let me share a bit about myself. I am a 30-year old male who graduated from a private university in Mindanao, and a nurse. Still, I never practiced my profession, was a corporate employee (BPO and financial industries) for seven years, and now four years as a self-employed/freelancer. I have five siblings (I am the youngest), and my parents are both in their 60s. So let's start with my personal experiences:\n\n1. Income: When I graduated ten years ago, I remember getting this as my first compensation package: 15k basic salary, 1.5k meal, and clothing allowance, 30 days PTO (like VL and SL combined), plus 500 rice allowance upon regularization. We were still paying income taxes at that time, so my net was around 6.5k every two weeks. Not much, but livable and A LOT better than working as a nurse volunteer. How was it? Not happy, but not miserable either. I used to work in a BPO office near at Mall of Asia, so I needed to rent somewhere in Paranaque. I remember not being able to afford the things I always wanted to have: nice leather shoes, a backpack that would maybe last me longer than a year or two, fiction books which I always read for free in Nat'l bookstore while standing, eat in a Japanese resto, etc. We were taking calls each day, and I remember going to the office one Christmas eve to get that much-coveted holiday OT premium on my paystub. How did I manage my money? I don't recall falling short of it, but I remember NOT SPENDING too much on discretionary items. When most people on their first jobs got themselves some electronic stuff or brought their SO's to an expensive date, I was still using the same bath towel, hankies, leather shoes, inside shirts, even undies, which were either a hand-me-down from my older brother back in college or those I had since high school. I also gave my parents around 2-3k per month for their household bills and helped my sister out in college (she took a 5-yr course, so I graduated a bit earlier). After less than a year, I jumped to several companies and, luckily, landed on a collection role that gave me the most significant boost in my earnings. Yes, totoo po iyong dati na tax namin ang sahod ng iba sa isang buwan, especially if you're a high-performing employee. I remember getting taxed around P15k when I earned a $1,000 commission, and I didn't know what to do at that time. Luckily, I already got a solid frugal mindset, so I could stash it away in a regular savings account instead of spending it. Over the years, I barely improved my salary (the highest I got was 25k basic plus a few thousand for allowances). So I decided to try freelancing/self-employment to control things, especially taxes.\n2. Education: I spent most of my childhood years in a public school. To those who never experienced studying there, ganito siya: there are about 50 or 60 of you in a classroom that was supposed to house 20 students max, if you are late, you get to use rickety chairs that could break any minute, fetching water somewhere else because the restroom doesn't have a working faucet or running water, padlocked laboratories whole year, so nobody is stealing or breaking anything, and a single textbook shared by 5-10 students. I would be a hypocrite if I said I enjoyed those times. Pero kahit ganun, I persevered and got a government scholarship (no connections, I went to a testing site and brought it based on the results) that helped me get into the university with the course I always wanted. It was a massive adjustment for me in my first year, especially with P40 as my allowance. Everyone can buy sodas and Snickers anytime. Queuing in the finance office during finals for any unpaid fees (my stipend is just that of a fixed amount), I also had to deal with professors who require students to buy this and that (books, NSTP shirt, earphones for speech class, etc.), or spend close to P50 pesos worth of handouts, etc. But alas, I graduated and passed the board. I was optimistic that I could finally enter med school, but my older siblings declined to support me. Instead, they asked me to take over sending money to my parents. I yielded to their request with a heavy heart and decided to work in the BPO industry and never looked back.\n3. Career: Nothing much to share. I started as a call center agent and never got promoted. Lol! I tried applying in several posts before: team leader, SME, trainer, QA, even a lateral transfer to a different department, but all of these were unsuccessful. Was I hurt? Yes. These positions I applied for included tasks I've been doing for months as a \"trainee\" on top of my current responsibilities. So technically, I am just trying to get the paperwork or title, but it never happened. A few years later, I left BPO and switched to banking. Here, I got a supervisory position and was handling sales/marketing. You might say, \"Oh, I thought you were never promoted?\". Nah, if you take branch selling, you will be required to regularly do client visits, which involves late or weekend meetings. Some companies give you a supervisory role to save themselves from paying you overtime, so I was more like an individual contributor, nothing else. After quitting, I tried going back to the BPO industry, but it didn't last longer than three months. I sought advice from one of my flatmates, and he encouraged me to try remote work, so I started looking for one in Upwork. I got a  full-time job from an exciting start-up company in Sydney and added a part-time California-based client (\\~20 hours/week with a 20% higher hourly rate) a couple of weeks later. Several Filipino employees were in the former, so I thought it was safe to talk about some stuff there. I had a colleague at that time with whom I shared my arrangement, and she asked me how I was able to \"easily\" get an additional client. I told her that I had already created a portfolio and uploaded it in Upwork. A few days later, the Sydney-based employer had us sign a confidentiality agreement which I didn't mind since almost every company requires it. I was surprised that my employer removed my login and access codes the following day. My Upwork profile was forcibly set in private (making you invisible if a prospective client searches for a contractor) also by Upwork. I talked to my Filipino supervisor over the phone about it and ayun, told me that I violated the confidentiality agreement daw which is a terminable offense. I got devastated kasi; first, they backdated the implementation of the agreement, second, there was no due process, and lastly, betrayed by someone whom I thought was a friend. Good thing I already got a job offer from a supposedly third client (\\~25 hours/week with 38% higher hourly rate) at that time, so it wasn't too much of a loss. Fast forward two years after, I quit the third one while the California-based client hired me full-time with a 120% bump in my hourly pay plus some benefits. What's more satisfying is that he referred me to his brother, so I get to work for him too. Now you want to ask me, \"Am I happy with my jobs?\" Sa totoo lang, not really. It pays the bills, but I feel destined for something greater than this. If there is one thing I can be proud of, it is SELF-DISCIPLINE. I still make sure that I meet expectations at work and do not short-change my clients with the required output. Looking for greener pastures is definitely on my radar, but as a middle class, I need to be extra calculating since we're still in a middle of an economic crisis.\n4. Insurance: I got my first insurance policy when I was only 20 y.o. It was a traditional retirement product from Manulife. I don't know what pushed me to avail it, probably because I saw the lack of preparedness from my parents and how it presently weighs down upon us. In 2014, I got a Sun Maxilink (a VUL) product but decided to cancel it two years later as I couldn't keep up with the payments (I think I lost around 20k due to fees the uncertainty brought by the elections). In 2017,  I added a term cover for critical illness, knowing that I now have no more employer-sponsored insurance as a remote contractor. Currently, I am paying P35k each year for all three policies.\n5. Investments: When I got my final pay from my last corporate job in 2017, I decided to open a UITF product, specifically SB High Dividend Equity Fund. It's still down 40% now, and I feel it would take a very long time to recover.\n\nThe things making it an uphill battle.\n\n1. Low and unequal wage distribution. I don't need to talk about why people in Metro Manila get paid higher than someone who lives in Cavite or Davao or why someone working in BGC is paid more than someone who does the same in Cebu. When I started working a decade ago, the entry-level salary for most BPO companies was roughly 12-25k per mo, and it hasn't gone up ever since. Stagnant wages are the biggest enemy of the middle class since most of us rely on our salaries.\n2. High taxes. Looking back, it makes me feel sick how the 20-year-old me paid around P1.5k/mo in income taxes from his P15k salary, and it never got better until I switched to self-employment.\n3. Inadequate social benefits. Getting good healthcare services requires that you have some private insurance or employer-sponsored HMO. If you are out of work, the best scenario is getting an unemployment benefit on average of P11,000 in TWO months. Our max SSS pension is currently around P17k, which can barely pay for all necessities. P2,400/mo disability benefit. Sickness benefit does not pay even the total amount of your daily wage. To compensate, we need to buy our financial products or look for companies willing to pay for them, primarily after-tax or out of pocket.\n4. Outrageously high property prices. Don't get me wrong, I never desired to live in a bungalow mansion, but who doesn't want to have his place, right? Pero wow, 25M for a studio or 1BR condo in BGC, around 15M in Makati,  and 10M in Alabang! A decent one in a secure neighborhood would cost you 20-25k/mo minimum for rent. Some people might argue eh di mag bed space or apartment. Oh right, those underdeveloped areas near them where you can get mugged late at night or bitten by a cockroach while sleeping. I wish it is that easy. Working from home helped improve my finances as I am now location-independent, but I still find it disheartening that entire villages surround our business districts.\n5. Inefficient and unresponsive government: If you still need an explanation on this one, I seriously think you live in a bubble.\n6. Toxic work culture. I always wonder why crab mentality is so ingrained in our system. Generally, I find working with Europeans, Jews, Aussies, Americans, Russians, and even Indians easier and with lesser dramas. Also, I noticed that we are non-confrontational, but we take things personally underneath. So instead of working together, our emotions get the best of us which plummets our productivity. I don't know, I may be biased due to my limited corporate experience, but it sure makes things more complicated than it already is.",

        "body": "Omg!!! I have the same sentiments at ganitong ganito napag-usapan namin ng asawa ko kahapon while discussing about our retirement.\n\nI have things to add sa mga sinulat mo based na din sa experience ko dito sa Canada:\n\n1. Low and unequal wage distribution. Nasa around 15-16K din ang salary ko when I started working as an accountant after I graduated. Then lumipat ako sa audit firm kahit mas bumaba sweldo ko kasi gusto kong i-practice pagka-CPA ko and sabi nila dati kapag galing ka ng audit firm madaling humingi ng malaking salary kapag lumipat ka sa ibang company. After 3 years nag-try ako maghanap ng bagong work kasi namumulubi na talaga ako sa work ko. Nagpasa ako sa apat na companies. Well, guess what? Ang layo sa expected salary ko ng offer nung tatlo at mga known na BPO companies ito ha. Luckily,  yung isa inofferan ako ng super lapit na sa asking price ko plus sobrang daming benefits at may profit share pa! Ang haba na pero ang point ko lang is akala ko dati kapag CPA ako malaki sweldo ko :( May mga clients din ako dati na akala nila malaki sweldo ko pero I think baka mas mababa pa nga kesa sa sweldo nila. One time nakita namin sweldo ng isa sa mga Directors namin sa audit firm (kasi naiwan nya sa printer yung application form sa lilipatan nya) na 10+ years na dun at nagulat kami kasi ang baba sa ineexpect namin :( Then lumipat siya sa isang multinational company pero ang baba lang din ng dagdag sa sweldo nya. For sure malaki asking nun kaya I think binarat siya at napilitan na lang din siguro siyang i-accept yung offer kasi sobrang dami talagang work sa audit firm at kapag inabutan ka pa ng start ng busy season ang hirap umalis.\n\nDito sa Canada mula nung nag-start ako mag-work malaki na din tinaas ng sweldo ko. Pero may itataas pa siguro yun kung hindi ako nag-mat leave twice. One year kasi ang mat leave dito so parang 2 years din akong hindi nag-work lol.\n\n2. High taxes. Sobrang laki ng taxes dito sa Canada! Haha. Pero madami ka namang pwedeng ma-deduct - yung sa daycare ng anak mo, medical expenses na hindi covered ng province nyo, tuition fees at pati nga contribution mo sa simbahan at madami pa. So far mula nung nag-migrate kami, palagi naman kaming may tax refund. Ang masasabi ko lang sa Pilipinas ay ang laki laki ng tax pero hindi mo ramdam! \n\n3. Inadequate social benefits. Eto yung pinaka-nakakafrustrate sa Pilipinas. Yung madami ka ngang ipon pero pwedeng maubos kapag nagkasakit ka ng malala kasi minsan hindi pa nga kayang bayaran ng Philhealth at private insurance mo. Instead na yung sakit mo lang ang isipin mo, dadgag pa sa iisipin mo magkano babayaran mo sa ospital. Hindi ko alam how much maternity benefit ngayon sa SSS pero ang mat leave dito ay pwede kang pumili between 12 or 18 months. The gov't will pay you a maximum of $595/week kung pinili mo yung 12 months or $357/week kung 18 months. Pwedeng way below to ng current salary mo pero most employers will top it up ng ilang months para 100% pa din ng salary mo nakukuha mo. And pagbalik mo may work ka pa din.\n\n4. Outrageously high property prices. 3.5 years ago nakabili kami ng bahay dito sa Canada na sa tingin namin hindi namin magagawa sa Pilipinas. Or makabili man kami baka sobrang layo na sa workplace namin. We have a 2 story house na may malaking backyard pero mas mahal pa yang 25M studio/1 BR na condo sa BGC na sinasabi mo lol. Pero to give context, sa prairies kami nakatira at hindi sa malalaking city so for sure mahal din properties kung let's say sa Toronto ka mismo nakatira. Pero so far yung mga friends namin from different provinces na may family din nakapag-pundar naman din sila ng bahay.\n\n5. Inefficient and unresponsive government: No brainer to pero ang nakakainis lang may mga friends pa din ako na sobrang fan ni Duterte. Alam mong fanatic sila kasi wala kahit isang bagay na ginawa niya ang ni-call out nila. Like really? Perfect yung Presidente? LOL. At saka ang ayaw ko sa Pilipinas eh yung maglalakad ka ng mga documents like NBI clearance at passport kasi ang haba ng pila palagi pero baka mas okay na siya ngayon. \n\n6. Toxic work culture: Sobrang tama ka dito. We take things personally. Sa work ko ngayon I can disagree with my boss at honestly tell him how I feel about work. Sa mga meetings akala mo may away na nangyayari kasi hindi mag-agree minsan sa isang bagay pero nari-resolve din siya and walang samaan ng loob after. Dito din ako natutong mag-No at hindi mag-overpromise. Sa Pilipinas kasi dati kapag tinanong ng boss ko kung kaya kong tapusin ng Friday sasabihin ko Oo pero ang totoo kailangan kong mag-overtime (without pay) para matapos siya kasi I feel na kapag sinabi kong hindi, he'll take it against me or bibigyan nya ko ng mababang performance rating. \n\n7. Gatekeeping based on educational background. I can't say much about this kasi I graduated from one of the top 4 universities. Siguro nga isa ako sa mga na-prioritize over the other candidates when I was applying before. Pero after naman ng first job mo hindi na nagma-matter kung san ka galing na school. Madami akong kakilala na hindi galing sa top universities pero ang layo na ng narating nila ngayon. Yung asawa ko hindi din galing sa isang top university pero mas magaling siya sakin 😂 \n\nAt isa pang ayaw ko sa Pilipinas is yung age discrimination sa work. Nung nag-land ako sa Canada nagulat ako kasi matatanda yung mga agents. Yung sa work ko madami ding ka-age na ng nanay at tatay ko. \n\nI'll stop here kasi ang haba na pala ng comment ko 😂",

I already know that the entry-level compensation for these firms were awfully low (18k-20k) per month but if you came from a non-priority school you'll really get the low-end of the bargain. I worked there for almost 2 years and the cost of living in Makati just killed me. I had to live in one of those \"capsule rooms\" where you only get like a room the size of 2 coffins stacked on top of one another because I literally cannot spend any more on a decent-sized room and still manage to sustain my other necessities and give back to my family in the province. Not only that, but there were cockroaches constantly entering the capsule because some tenants just don't understand the concept of cleanliness I suppose. I can't even sit properly inside of my \"capsule\". I spent one year there and I know this may sound weird but the pandemic may have been an unexpected eye-opener for me since I got to get out of my old living conditions and stay at my parent's house back at the province through our work-from-home arrangement. I realized that the income disparity in Makati was really not worth it and decided to quit my job to hopefully find a much favorable one here in the province.",

I initiated the conversation through the FB Marketplace messaging system. I know I was stupid not doing this: I did not check out the FB profile of the “Jayson Lambino” that posted this Marketplace listing. I tried to arrange a meet-up to complete the purchase. He said he lives in Antipolo and can’t do a meet up far from his place because he is “taking care of his baby” (I suggested a meet-up in Robinsons Antipolo). Since I reside in Fairview, I thought of having the item sent to my place instead and send the payment through GCash.\n\nJune 20, 2023: We agreed to have the item sent on this day. I offered to book a GrabExpress and asked him for his details. Unfortunately, after many attempts, no available riders seem to be near his place (pick up point: Mahogany St. San Luis Antipolo (he said he resides in Antipolo Hills but will just walk to Mahogany St. where pick up would be easier)). He then offered to have the service booked from his end instead through Lalamove (I don’t have Lalamove and never tried using it) and I agreed. He was sending me screenshots of the booking updates until a rider accepted and was heading to the pick-up point. He then messaged me that the rider has arrived and he was making sure that the item is secure. I was asking him to send the tracking link. At this point he was telling that reception is poor where he was at. He sent a GCash account (which was not in his name, but to a Mae June A., claiming it was her wife’s account) saying that I should send the payment before he will let the rider go. I sent a partial (but huge lol) payment of 12,000 saying that I will send the remaining 1,000 after he sends the tracking link. A few minutes after sending the receipt of the transaction, the listing got deleted and I can’t send messages anymore. I searched for the name in Facebook but the exact account wasn’t showing up, but I saw a similarly named account using a different profile image and was from Antipolo. I clicked this profile and lo and behold, there was a pinned public post warning and saying that someone is using his name, pictures, pictures of his ID who is scamming people by fake selling a DSLR camera set. I realized I was indeed scammed so I searched online what I can do and found out that swindling can be reported in GCash (transaction was from my GCash account to the swindler’s GCash account, this is good news). I proceeded and a Gcash rep suspended the swindler’s GCash account after about an hour of me sending the ticket. They asked me to submit a police report of the incident within 72 hours. I searched for similar experiences (in Reddit, blogs, FB posts) and found a helpful blog post online narrating his experience of being swindled by a fake seller, submitting a ticket to GCash, and going to Camp Tomas Caringal (QC District Anti-cybercrime Team) to report the incident. I reside within QC and decided to go to the same office to report the incident I experienced.\n\nJune 21, 2023: I went to Camp Tomas Caringal - QCDACT (near Maginhawa) to submit a police report and mentioned that this was a requirement by GCash. Took a photo of the BLOTTER EXCERPT and sent it to GCash (as an email reply). A GCash rep acknowledged the document.\n\nJuly 19, 2023: I received an update from GCash advising me to send a notarized Narrative Report and Request Letter and a notarized Quitclaim (they provided the templates as pdf files), selfies holding those documents, and a photo of a government valid ID within 72 hours.\n\nJuly 20, 2023: I sent all the accomplished requirements requested yesterday.\n\nJuly 24, 2023: The PHP 12,000 amount reflected in my GCash account (the account I used to send the payment to the swindler’s GCash account) and is reflecting in my Transactions as “ADJUSTMENT”. GCash alerted me thru SMS and email with the progress. Ticket is now tagged as “Handled”.\n\nThe blog post I referred to as a guide never mentioned that he was able to retrieve the swindled amount (or part of it) and I wasn’t able to find any posts narrating their experience and actually being able to get back the swindled amount so here I am posting mine to let you guys know that it is possible.\n\nThe swindled amount can only be retrieved if the amount was still in the swindler’s GCash account at the time the CGash rep processes your ticket (in my experience, GCash rep sent a response that the swindler’s account has been temporarily suspended and all of the recoverable amount is still in the account about an hour after submitting the ticket).",

Come with them clean and extend a number you can go by in the next months. If it means prolonging the loan to 5 more years with a higher interest and lower monthly, do so. Yes, **ask for a loan restructuring**.

Mahirap tlga yan both mental at physical and marami tlagang gastos, milyon milyon. I've been on the same boat as you, ako lang breadwinner sa family of 5 adults. 2 elders and 1 with disability.\n\n  \nIto mga solution ko for you.\n\nIMMEDIATE ACTIONS:\n\n1. Makiusap ka s mga banks for loan reconstruction. Try mo ipa extend terms to lower monthly payments. As much as gusto ko ma-debt free ka agad, hindi mo kakayanin for now. So ito muna unahin mo kung d mo kaya mapataas immediately ung income stream mo.\n\n2. Side Gigs for you and husband - I used to work 16hrs a day just to pay off all debts. I know, hindi to kaya ng body and marami pang health issues pag prolonged. Pero why not dalawa kau ni husband na magwork for a single job? Find a work na pwedeng tig 4hrs kau ni husband. Ginawa ko na din to with a friend nun kasi dalawa kaming baon s utang. Ang pros nga dito e yung productivity hati din saming dalawa kya ang gaganda ng output and mas mabilis ang raise.\n\n3. Ask for financial help for your parent na may cancer from government programs/congressman/etc - nagbibigay sila lalo pag malapit eleksyon.\n\n  \nNEXT STEPS:\n\nSince 5 yrs kana sa VA job, baka pwede mo naman gawin ung same output with less time? I used to do a single VA job for 12hrs a day (tech job na mahirap) for 20K a month. 6 years later 2hrs a day ko nlng ginagwa ung job, 50K salary (boss gave me yearly increase). When I started to have more time for myself, nag upskill ako s marketing. Ngaun I have multiple digital marketing clients, multiple side income sources (websites, stocks and dividends) and a thriving construction business (On my way to establishing the business to a corporation.)\n\nAng formula ko lang LEARN MORE, SIPAG, AUTHENTICITY SA WORK, DISIPLINA SA GASTOS. Meron ka ng Sipag at Disiplina OP.\n\nSa ilang years na nasa Poor Income class ang family ko at ilang beses pinalayas ng apartment (since bata p ko), na-realize ko na need mo tlga mag upskill and learning high value skills for more money.\n\n  \n2. INVEST - \n\n- health insurance (for yourself and immediate family for future proofing), \n\n- stock market (recommend ko ung copy trade ng Etoro kasi dun ako kumita ng malaki pra ipang invest s construction business. Dunno kung may other advice regarding better ways than i did)\n\n- own business - since VA ka din like ako, our jobs are not always stable. high income but not stable. Kelangan mo tlga ng side business.\n\n  \nOP, naiintindihan kita. Pray ka lang din and I'll include you in my prayers too.",

Do them all.\n\n1. Ask for donations from other people pambayad ng principal. Pumila sa PCSO, local charity, sumali sa game shows sa tv na namimigay ng pera to entertain their viewers, etc. \n\n2. Take out a loan sa sss and pagibig. Use that to pay part of your debt. Mas mababa interest nila.  Pero maliit lang din maloan mo. Better than nothing. Try to find if merong magrefinance ng utang ninyo at a lower rate. Keep checking this regularly kahit partial. Same concept why u will take a loan sa sss Nd Pagibig. \n\n3. Humanap kayo parehas ng mas stable na job. 50k sa VA after paying dues philhealth.. sss etc..  siguro nasa 30k+ lang din net. Ngayon mo mas kailangan ng philhealth at sss dahil wala ka pambayad ng ibang insurance. Si hubby 30k is just plain small.

    "title": "Launched a Salon at the end of January. This month we hit 400K in revenue.",
    "body": "Wanted to share our my journey of investing into a brand new salon and how we grew it to 400k in revenue in 4 months.\n\n  \nSharing so others can throw in their ideas or learn something from our journey. I truly believe that 2 heads (well thousands in this case) are better than one, so share what's on your mind. The good, the bad, the ugly.\n\n\n\n  \n**My background:**  \nI've been a freelance digital strategist/media buyer for a few years now, primarily in eCommerce and have been fortunate enough to work with some of the largest advertisers on Meta, TikTok, Snap and Google. My bread and butter is digital strategy but a big part of it is creative strategy as well.\n\n\n\n**Preface:**\n\nSo in October 2023 a family member finally let me advertise their Salon since it looked like they weren't going to be able to cover their business expenses that month. The salon already had a very good reputation for their work and already had an established customer base however, they had no marketing other than sending their customers DMs on FB reminding them to come over for a hair treatment.\n\n I launched some really basic facebook ads using common direct response practices, thing before and after shots, videos, basic \"tiktok\" style videos etc.\n\n  \nIt took a couple of days to optimize but by the end of the 2nd week after launch all bills were covered and they even had a little left for themselves. Ever since then I've been doing the bare minimum managing their ad campaigns.\n\n  \nThe year ended quite well for them with them peaking at 500k in sales in December. In November they asked me and my GF if we wanted to invest into a 2nd branch in the neighboring city and after talking things over, we agreed.\n\n\n\n**Month 1 - January/February**\n\nIt took us about 3 weeks to find a location, renovate, buy equipment and train 1 helper. We were able to keep everything fairly cheap and invested a total of 200K into the salon, this included everything we needed, even the chemicals used.\n\nI was made responsible for everything digital so that included setting up a brand new page, planning all posts for the next 60 days(I just copied everything from their 1st salon and re-uploaded onto the new page), run some ads to hype up the salon etc. Overall, nothing too interesting here since it's all basically the most common things you'd want to do when setting up a new business.\n\nLeading up the grand opening, I started running the same ads that we ran in the 1st salon just with different text. I did put a lot more focus to refine some details to make them even more direct response by changing colors, fonts, more click-baity text etc.\n\nThe 1st month was pretty stressful for everyone since we knew our fixed expenses were about 70k every month and we were really pushing hard to cover them. Everything was new, we had new people that had to be trained while doing the work etc. Finding a workflow that was efficient took us about 3 weeks, we just sucked at it lol. It got so bad I even forgot to pay an outstanding electric bill so we had 1 day where we couldn't take on new customers.\n\n  \nOverall the 1st month ended pretty well.\n\nSales - 184K\n\nExpenses - 133K\n\nNet - \\~51K\n\n  \nBesides rent, salaries etc, Meta ads ended up costing us about 26K that month which is still pretty good.\n\nSince every business is basically in the Lifetime Value game, we also took down every person's name and phone number that came to our salon. We haven't done it yet but we're planning to reach out to them every 3 months to remind them to get a hair treatment.\n\n  \nEvery expense and customer is encoded in a google sheet and it's been our bible in providing us the exact numbers of the business.\n\n  \n**Month 2 & 3 - March & April**\n\nSo with month 2 and 3, not much changes except we were finally getting more walk-ins from people who would pass by the salon or people who saw our ads and just  decided to pop in. Meta ads still contributed to the largest sales driver.\n\nI'm a little disappointed in myself to not push harder in April eventhough the numbers justified it. Remember when I said we track everything from customer name, revenue, services they availed etc? I figured out our conversion rates from meta ads, how much each customer cost us to come into the salon, how much our average cost was in labor, overhead and materials etc. \n\n  \nWeek over week I saw conversion rate maintain between 5% to 7%. No matter if I increased the budget slightly or decreased it. We also focused heavily on picturing and videoing all of our work. Its all used for our social media accounts plus most of them are used for our ads to stay on top of creative diversity and creative learning. Right now we've testing close to 70 creatives ranging from statics, videos, GIFs etc.\n\nSo how did we end the months?\n\nMarch Sales - 204K\n\nMarch Expenses - 133K\n\nMarch Net - 70K  \n\n\nApril Sales - 212k\n\nApril Expenses - 157K\n\nApril net - 54K\n\n  \nApril we had a few more expenses as we had to replace our AC and other things coming up.\n\n\n\n**Month 4 - May**\n\n\n\nMay Sales - 406k\n\nMay Expenses - 253K\n\nMay Net - 153K\n\n  \nSo what happened in May? I believed my numbers lol\n\nI doubled down on ads, we ended up spending 2k a day with conversion rate maintaining at about 7%. Turns out scaling from 200k to 400k in sales wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. Yes there are other challenges such as not having enough space, needing to hire someone just to respond to your inquiries, morale being slightly down since it's a lot more work etc but it's sort of a poof of concept to trust the numbers.\n\n\n\nWhere to go from now? I'd like to keep the ad budget the same but this month give remarketing a try and increase sales without spending much more. We have over  450 phone numbers at this point, so we will start reaching out to them to remind them to get follow up hair treatments etc.\n\n  \nI just realized that this is a long ass post and I hope you didn't get too bored. Sorry for my spelling mistakes in advance lol.\n\n  \nAlso, feel free to ask questions, I love feedback both good and bad.\n\n",

Kaya sa sobrang delaying gratification naming mag asawa iisipin ko na bilhin na yung gusto nya kapag may extra, sya din nagiipon ng sarili para daw mabili din yung gusto ko haha.

Sya din magaling sa mga documents ako naman sa numbers. \n\n\nMga hindi namin afford noon ngayon afford na namin, sabi namin we're in this together, galing kami sa baba at sabay kaming umaakyat at maabot mga pangarap namin. Sobrang perfect naming 2, kumbaga we're each other's missing pieces. We complete each other. Two is better than one samin. 🥰 \n\n\nKaya sa mga pipili ng makakasama habang buhay kilalanin nyo na agad mag jowa palang kayo huwag kayong maging bulag sa red flag, we're not perfect madami din kaming flaws pero yung flaws na kaya naming tanggapin and itolerate pero hindi naman nakakasira ng relasyon at pagkatao and we still work it out gumagawa ng paraan para magbago for the better. Yung handang mag compromise, yung priority namin ang isa't isa at ang pamilya.\n\n\nI remember kasi nung nagpropose na sya sakin nilatag ko talaga lahat sa kanya ng beliefs ko and no.1 na sinabi ko din is ayokong pgaawayan namin ang pera, kung tingin nya hindi ako compatible sa beliefs nya when it comes to finances sabihin na nya agad para matignan ano pwedeng ma compromise ko, same din sa kanya sinabi ko mga bagay na napapansin ko, sabi ko din ayokong magtataguan kami ng pera na nagbigay pala kami sa iba hindi namin sinabi etc etc. Ayun kaya alam namin agad kung bagay ba kami para mamuhay ng habany buhay haha.",

I was simply curious. Posted this for those who were also curious.

Hopefully mag research muna sila. Kung may bills ka at nababaon ka na sa utang at kailangan mo ng pambayad, PARA SAYO TO.  Whatever happens, please **DO NOT** take this loan or you’ll regret digging your own grave soon after. Please look for other ways rather than depending on online loans or lending apps.",

Maganda to sa mga sellers like naghahabol sila ng inventory for upcoming campaign, meron sila pang replenish ng stocks nila right away. Kung sa bank kasi na super tagal ng approval, wala na di na aabutan yung pambayad ng supplier nila. Lahat naman ng negosyo need ng urgent loan sometimes. Konting kita is still kita. Yan yung sinasabi nila na pwede ka magpalaki ng negosyo mo ng kahit walang capital na ganun kalaki. Spaylater is for buyers naman nung nagcompute ako 3.67%/mo including dst, okay naman to kasi may exclusive vouchers for spaylater payment. When you deduct the free sf or cashback vouchers exclusive for spaylater payment plus yung discount for flash sales, almost none nalang din ang interest which is comparable na sa may cc na walang interest for a month. When I compared to gcash/gloan/ggives ang kapareho niya si spaylater. SLoan medyo ok pa kasi malaki credit limit tapos wala collateral. Pang urgent business need lang talaga siya na need ng big spending. Nasa tao lang yan kung gagawin na opportunity yung ganto or ilulubog mo sarili sa utang. Hindi lahat kaya magprovide ng loan docs sa bank, and I think good thing na may ganto. Hindi din lahat may creditcard na madami offers na mababang interest. Remember, halos mga tao sa shopee mga small sellers yan. Mga tao nga sa palengke they resort to 5/6 bombay that’s 20% monthly pero kumikita pa din sila. For end-consumer, I’d rather go for lazpaylater ng lazada, 0% for 1month sila rather than using spaylater ni shopee. Yun lungs 😊",

    "body": "Alam mo yung kasabihan na \"Mahirap maging mahirap?\" Mali. Mas mahirap maging stockholder, homeowner, supplier, empleyado, o lupang naagaw sa Villar empire. Kasi dito, kahit saan ka lumingon, may paraan para kang malugi.\n\n\nI used to buy stocks related to Villar but never again.\n\n\nI've talked to friends, colleagues, bankers, vendors, and employees of Villar-owned companies, and haven't heard a single positive thing about them.\n\n\n- Walang Bayad ang Suppliers \n\n\nMay kakilala akong nag-supply sa AllDay at Coffee Project. Akala niya magandang negosyo. Akala niya malaking kumpanya, maayos magbayad. Limang taon na, hindi pa rin bayad. Kahit demand letter, wala silang pake. Parang libre nilang ginagamit ang produkto mo habang ikaw, bahala kang masira ang negosyo mo.\n\n\n- Walang Tubig ang Homeowners \n\n\nKung nasa isang Villar subdivision ka at hawak kayo ng Primewater, hindi mo na kailangang mag-abala magbukas ng gripo. Wala namang lalabas.\n\n\nMay tubig? Wala. May bill? Laging meron. May reklamo? Wag ka nang umasa. \n\n\nKung may dumating mang tubig, mabilisan, tapos ubos agad. Pero ang singil? Tuloy-tuloy, minsan abot ng libo kahit hindi mo nagamit. Lahat ng kapitbahay nagsisisi na bumili sakanila (lalo na mga OFWs).\n\n\n- Walang Kwenta ang Stocks \n\n\nVillar IPO playbook:\n\n\nHype sa media Pump ang presyo Iwan ang retail investors na bagsak ang hawak \n\n\nKung naipit ka sa AllDay, VistaREIT, Vistamalls, o Medilines IPO, alam mo na ang sakit ng bumagsak na stock. Akala mo blue-chip, yun pala basura stock. Habang ikaw, nag-aabang bumalik ang presyo, sila - nakalabas na at panalo na.\n\n\n- Walang Refund, Walang Turnover\n \n\nMay tropa akong bumili ng Vista Residences condo sa Mindanao. Delayed nang ilang taon, walang refund.\n\n\nSa Cavite naman, may forced turnover-walang tubig, walang kuryente, WALANG SUSI. Parang pre-order ng bahay, pero scam. Hindi mo alam kung actual unit mo yung tinurn-over sayo o placeholder lang habang patuloy silang nagbenta.\n\n\n- Walang Respeto sa Homeowners \n\n\nBumili ka ng bahay sa isang Villar subdivision. Tapos isang araw, nagising ka na lang, ginawang highway extension ang bahay mo. Walang abiso, walang konsultasyon basta giba!\n\n\nKung gusto mong magreklamo, good luck. Binayaran mo na, bahala ka na sa buhay mo.\n\n\n- Walang Kwentang Employer\n \n\nSabi ng isang dating empleyado sa Villar Group:\n\n\nMinamadali ang lahat ng proyekto, pero sahod laging late. Toxic work environment, trap sa office politics. Shortcuts sa construction materials, pero premium pricing sa market. \n\n\nKaya pala kada buwan, may hiring. Pero yung sahod? Wala pa rin.\n\n\n- Walang Takot sa Land Grabbing \n\n\nMay ilang farmers at landowners na biglang nawalan ng lupa dahil naging parte na ito ng bagong Villar project. Ang dating palayan, naging subdivision. Paano nangyari? Hindi mo na rin malalaman. Ang sigurado, wala ka nang laban.\n\n---\n\nKung stockholder ka, homeowner, supplier, empleyado, o may lupa na nawala - lahat ng anggulo, may paraan silang gatasan ka.\n\n\nKung OFW ka at iniisip mong mag-invest sa Villar IPOs, preferred shares, REITs, condo, o subdivision - isipin mong mabuti. Kasi kung may paraan para maisahan ka, sigurado, covered na nila yan.\n\n\nIsa na rin ako sa mga nalugi dahil sa Villar-owned company. This serves as a warning.\n\n\nUpdate 1: Uunahan ko na yung magsasabi na \"Eh kumita naman ako sa HVN!\" - Oo, maraming nakasabay doon, pero tanong: Dahil ba maganda talaga ang negosyo o dahil lang sa hype? Ginamit lang ang HVN para i-pump ang ibang Villar stocks, pero kita mo naman ang sumunod - bagsak lahat. Kung nakalabas ka sa HVN na may kita, good for you. Pero kung iniisip mong mauulit yun sa ibang Villar IPOs, baka ikaw naman ang maiwan sa taas sa susunod.\n\nUpdate 2: All Villar owned properties will be very hard to resell in the secondary market because of Primewater. Kung lagi walang tubig, matuturn-off yung buyers. Mahal din sila magcharge for the water, and if malate ka lang ng payment ng 1 day, puputulin agad nila yung water connection niyo, and good luck explaining it to their customer service.\n\nYung HOA nila, puru Villar appointees. Kung may reklamo kay, tiyak na walang mangyayari. In the end, wala na nagbabayad ng HOA fees kaya wala na rin streetlamps pati security guard.\n\nAs for the Internet, Villar's Streamtech lang ang pwede mong gamitin. It's worse than PLDT. And NO, they don't allow any other internet service providers.\n\nShare this to your loved ones to avoid investing in their companies. Maraming OFWs na hindi alam ang shenanigans nila. They keep sponsoring Willie Revillame's shows to target unsuspecting OFWs.\n\nYung mga may negative experience sa mga Villar-owned companies, please share it here. Let your voices be heard para wala na mabiktimang iba from their unethical business practices. Ilan beses na sila na-complain sa Tulfo, and wala pa ring nangyayari.",

    "title": "Filipino Business Nightmares: From Government Red Tape to Vanishing Employees",
    "body": "Just today, I read a post on phinvest that the FDA increased the price of one of their requirements by 1500%.\n\nGrabe, hirap talaga magnegosyo sa Pilipinas.\n\nShare ko lang din...\n\nA few years ago, I decided to start a business with some family members on the side while working my corporate job. I thought it was a smart move - keep my stable income while slowly building something of my own. At first, it was exciting. I was motivated, full of ideas, and ready to grind.\n\nBut reality hit fast.\n\nWhat I thought would be a simple side hustle turned into a never-ending cycle of stress, unexpected expenses, and employee drama.\n\nReality hit when I talked to other small business owners, and they all had the exact same struggles.\n\nIf you’re thinking of starting a business in the Philippines, maybe you should read this first...\n\n1. The Never-Ending Paperwork and Surprise Fees \n\nSince I still had my full-time job, I thought registering the business would be easy. Big mistake.\n\nI had to juggle trips to BIR, DTI, Barangay Hall, City Hall, Bureau of Fire, and more each one with its own set of requirements and fees. Some offices said, \"Balik na lang po next week, offline pa system namin.\" Next week? Still offline. I finally got all the permits, but surprise! I had to renew them every year - kahit wala pa akong masyadong kita. Miss a deadline? Automatic penalty. Walang patawad. \n\nOne business owner I met said, “In the Philippines, bago ka pa kumita, gobyerno na ang unang kikita.” So true.\n\n2. The Case of the Vanishing Employees \n\nI hired staff thinking they’d help me grow the business while I focused on my corporate job. Another big mistake.\n\nSome quit after 1-3 months - some leave after getting their first salary or after 13th-month pay. Others didn’t even bother resigning. They just stopped showing up. No text, no explanation, nothing. A few even borrowed money before disappearing. (“Boss, pa-advance lang po...” Next day? Number cannot be reached)\n\nProductivity? Walang nagbago. Minimum wage keeps increasing, but work ethic? Pareho lang... o mas bumaba pa.\n\nI invited 100 people to the interview, 10 lang sumipot, and 1 lang ang qualified. Dun sa isa na yun, magisstay lang sa akin ng 1-3 months and then hanap na ulit bagong trabaho.\n\nI talked to other small business owners, and they all said the same thing: \"Ang hirap maghanap ng matinong empleyado ngayon\"\n\nAkala ko ba kulang ang trabaho sa Pilipinas?\n\n3. Copy-Paste Competitors & Price Wars \n\nAfter months of struggling, we finally started getting regular customers. Then, suddenly, new businesses popped up - selling the exact same thing.\n\nSome copied our branding, pricing - lahat. Worse, even our suppliers started selling directly to customers at lower prices. It became a price war. We sold at Php150, they sold at Php99, then someone else started selling at Php79. \n\nA business friend told me: \"Wala nang loyalty sa negosyo. The moment may mas mura, lilipat agad customers mo\"\n\n4. The Great Filipino Budget Paradox \n\nOne of the most frustrating things we experienced? Filipino customers expect premium quality - but only want to pay rock-bottom prices.\n\n\"Ayoko ng Made in China, gusto ko Japan!\"\n\n\"Sir/Ma'am, this is Made in Japan, premium quality\"\n\n\"Ay ang mahal! Wala bang mas mura?\" \n\nPeople even compared our prices to Shopee sellers offering free shipping, cashback, and Php1 flash sales. Some would even say, “Pwede discount? Kahit Php10 lang.”\n\nOne of my business friends runs a repair shop. Customers always say:\n“Boss, ayusin mo na muna, babayaran ko na lang pag okay na... ”Then they never come back.\n\n5. BIR: Everybody Fears the Taxmen\n\nEven though I filed my taxes properly, BIR still found a way to make my life miserable.\n\nOne day, I got a notice saying:\n\n\"Sir, may tax deficiency po kayo. You owe Php3-5M\"\n\nMe: \"Pero less than Php1M lang ang net profit namin!\"\n\nBIR: \"Ah ganun po? Pwede naman natin pag-usapan... Php200K na lang, cash na lang ha?\" \n\nI thought this was just bad luck, but every single business owner I know has a similar story. Some even said BIR does this every few years, like clockwork.\n\nNo matter how honest you are with taxes, they will always find a way to tell you that you owe them more.\n\n---\n\nIf you can handle red tape, ghosting employees, price-cutting competitors, demanding customers, and extortion disguised as taxes, then sure, go ahead.\n\nBut if you think starting a business is an \"escape\" from your corporate job, think again. Running a business is often 10x more stressful than a 9-to-5 job.\n\nAfter everything I went through, I realized one thing:\n\nIn the Philippines, success in business isn’t just about hard work - it’s about surviving an unfair system.",

Iniluluwas niya para dalhin sa mga anak na nasa malayo. Madalas siyang wala sa bahay nang dalawa o tatlong linggo tapos uuwi na rin kase marami na daw sha ulit gamasin.\n\nKasama rin sa kanyang routine ang pagkuha ng sulit sa lukad, pamamalengke tuwing tiangge sa bayan, pag-aasikaso ng amilyar ng mga lupa, pagbisita sa taniman, pag-attend ng meetings at hearings sa mga kaso sa lupa, at pagdalaw sa kanyang bestie na pinsan niya para mag-huntahan at mag-nganga. Tuwing araw ng mga patay, nagpapalinis at nagpapa-pintura din sha ng mga puntod. Hindi sha mahilig mamili ng kung ano ano. Ang mga damit nya puro patahi lang sa modista. Napaka simple lang talaga.

More importantly, it's a great place for them to socialize and make friends. \n\n3. They built a vacation house. \n\nMy dad loves the water so my parents obtained a modest beach house.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

    "body": "Pa rant lang, naiinis na kasi ako. I availed PruLife 10 years exact Protrector, 8 years ago. It was thru my acquaintance, since wala pakong major financial responsibility, kaya I gave it a go and as a support na din sa kanya. I paid it diligently without fail or delay kasi it was automatically deducted from my bank account monthly. I paid minimal to no attention to it but honestly I felt good and proud that I was insured.\nEven encouraging my friends to get an insurance as well and lowkey argues with those who are against it.\n\nThis year after joining different financial groups and discussions, I realised that there are more negative experiences than the good ones, especially when it comes to claiming the rightful insurance that they paid for. I always give the PruLife the benefit of the doubt for every bad experience or rant I read about them. I always think maybe the policy holder doesn't comply to the rules, or they have missed/delayed payments and so on. \n\nFinally, I decided to try and visit my online account. Like I said I seldom opens it, maybe twice or thrice in the duration of 8 years and never really explored it. I was kinda disappointed that in the duration of 8 years (I think 96 or 97 months) my account only accumulates around P150,000. I was deeply saddened thinking that the least I could get if I finished the term was 200k, that was the least amount I was expecting because my agent gave me an estimate of 300k - 500k tops, explaining that some portions of my money will be invested in stocks. And to think that I only have 2 more years to complete the term, I felt really disappointed.\n\nNow, I tried to withdraw partially, 100k at first, tutal nakaka-dissapoint naman na yung 150k for 8 years, why not bawasan ko na, and kudos to PruLife I received it within 3-5 days like the email mentioned. Now, my account only got around 50k-60k left, not much but still a significant amount. I decided to fully withdraw my policy. I read the contract, followed the right procedure for my full withdrawal, accomplished the request form,  email it to them along with some IDs and signatures etc. They confirmed the transaction and requested my policy to be sent to them either via email for digital documents or to their customer care center for physical documents. \n\nSo I sent all the requested documents via email days before the deadline, and again they confirmed it. I thought the transaction would be as easy as my first withdrawal, but no, after 55 days of multiple follow ups, receiving the same auto-generated email asking me to  send and resend the SAME documents they requested and received in the first place, they finally declined my transaction. The reason was \"Kindly resubmit  partial withdrawal request with lower amount (PHP 45,000 or below)\"\n\nIt was not about the left over money in my account, I just kinda feel betrayed and really disappointed. Not to my agent or to those who are sending me the emails. Maybe just to their system in general. To think that they are supposedly good healthcare and financial advocates. \n\nF! U! PruLife!\n\n\n***\n\nUpdate: 7 mins after posting this, I received an email (not auto-generated), asking for the same documents they asked and received months ago. WTF!\n\n\n***\n\nUpdate: The other friend of mine who has an officemate who's an ex-Pru agent, told her that this post would possibly get down-voted to death. The managers would share to their members to trash and discredit posts like this that tarnishes their \"good reputation\".\n\nHer officemate actually said \"madami kasi mawawalan ng prospects, wala na silang pang pre-order ng iPhone 17\"",

Yung year 8-10, doon pa lang napupunta yung buong monthly payments mo sa stocks.\n\nLife and health insurance are extremely helpful, and they also give you peace of mind if ever something bad happens, that's why I prefer term life insurance and pure health insurance over VULs.\n\n✌🏻",

I was about to sign the insurance term and life savings component etc. Then I did a quick glance at the return. It says mag start ang return around year 3 ata so you don't really get anything in the first 3 years and just kept paying. And at the end of 10 years the return is not bad pero it equates to saving with a little bit of interest on top. But I have stocks already and it performed way better than this. My 300k invested in stocks turned into 1.2M. So I declined at the last minute much to the disappointment ng friend ko na hindi ako kinausap hanggang ngayon, simply because it's better to get a cheaper insurance only option and do the investing on my own.",

They show financial projections dun sa contract. They still show this even when the actual yearly performance is below 4%. Syempre umasa ako na tataas.

It is exactly what it claims to be, which is life insurance, no more no less.. This is mainly the fault of the agents who over promise and continuously label certain policies with any form of withdraw-able funds that accumulate annual interest (usually around 2.5%) as \"investments\".. They are not, they are purely life insurance just with the added feature of having some of the money you put into it being available for you to withdraw unlike other forms of insurance like a car insurance wherein whatever money you've paid for it is basically gone..\n\nLife Insurance again I would say is a must before you start investing your money..

The thing is, everybody here has a point: the best any single person can do is look out for themselves.\n\nThe second best is to unite to forward our causes.

Vote in politicians with progressive and effective accomplishments, solid policies and an adaptive and humane outlook at governance. Dismiss once then ignore politicians who are full of gas-filled rhetoric, empty scheming promises and a push towards cult-of-personality fanaticism. Do the same with their supporters and propaganda pushers.\n* Want less traffic? Stop buying cars! Find people you can share a ride with to and from work, bike, aim for and support WFH companies.\n* Want cheaper, more sustainable food? Start a community garden, reach out to local producers, try a a barter system, find a local coop that is actually supporting your local community and not one that's only making money off your community.\n\nThe above is just a simple list but already anyone can see all the difficulties. Which is why it's the second best thing to do for a single person. Emphasis on \"single person\". A community needs different priorities.\n\nChanging a community, a government, a society is difficult and takes so so long. It's \"plant trees that your children can enjoy\" long. Progressive, positive and lasting change, is difficult. Anyone who glibly declares \"change is coming\" means to scam you.",

    "body": "**Hi everyone! I’m 25 years old and have been freelancing full-time for a year and five months now.** Grateful to share that I’ve been able to save 500K during this time. 🙏\n\nSo far, I’ve used part of my savings to buy a good-condition second-hand car (300K) and renovate our family home (around 300–400K). What’s left is 500K, which I currently consider as my emergency fund (around 12 months' worth, with 40K in monthly expenses. Please note that I’m the breadwinner).\n\nI know freelancing can be unpredictable, but I currently have 3 stable clients. If I’m able to keep them until the end of the year, I expect to save 1M–1.3M, as I consistently put aside 80K–100K every month. I also have a source of \"passive\" income which gives me 10-50K  per month depends on how I aggressively promote my products   \n  \n(but right 98% of my income comes from handling clients since I have been focusing on improving my skills)\n\nNow here’s where I’d really love your advice and insights:\n\nStarting next month, I want to begin investing, maybe 50K–100K into MP2. But a part of me really wants to hit 1M in savings **first** (just for that psychological boost and motivation). I know it might sound petty, but that milestone really means something to me. And my goal for this year is to make money so I can atleast ease myself, as a breadwinner I'm hesitant to take a lot of risks, since next year I'll take more risks so I can make money. I have to have a HUGE back up so I can take risks more.\n\nThat said, I also want to be smart with my money. So here's my question:\n\n**Is it reasonable to wait until I save 1M before starting to invest or would it be better to start investing now, even if I haven’t hit that 1M yet?**\n\nAlso, looking ahead:\n\n* I want to grow my income to 300K/month next year and save 150K/month consistently\n* My long-term goal is to save 9M by age 30\n* I plan to start investing more aggressively next year (diversified across different types) (I am still learning all of this, my current marketing client is a multimillionaire and she is a finance coach too. I am very inspired with her and I learn a lot)\n\nAnd on another note,I’m also an aspiring entrepreneur and currently working in marketing. I *really* want to improve in what I do. Right now, I still feel pretty average, and I want to level up.\n\nSo if you have any book recommendations that were game changers for you, **financial or business/marketing-related,** please share them! Or if you follow any really helpful, down-to-earth people in the marketing/entrepreneurship space, I’d be so grateful for your recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance! I’m very open to learn from everyone here",

I was money hungry just like you too, but make sure you don't burnout. \n\n3. Have a scarcity mindset and only spend money you have. Freelancing is crazy and with the upcoming recession you can be dropped by your client easily.\n\n4. MP2 is your friend. No tax and an interest rate of around 6% yearly.\n\n5. DCA in stocks. I personally do crypto because the returns are better, but if you want something less risky you can go with the SPY 500. You can buy stocks at IBKR or GoTrade.\n\n6.

        "body": "Yes! I recommend saving up the 1M muna before diving into investing. This will give you more flexibility for other investment opportunities later in life when you have liquid savings. MP2 is just one of those options\n\nI think my current situation might offer some insights since it could feel like I’m your “future self” once you achieve that 1M in liquid savings\n\nI’m 27 years old, also a freelancer, and I have passive income generating around 40k-45k per month with 3 clients, which brings my total monthly income to 300k-330k. I will be ending my contract with one of my clients this mid-month, so my monthly income will drop to 250k-280k. I’m also a breadwinner.\n\nI keep my funds in three different digibanks: Seabank, Maya, and GoTyme. I also set aside 80k-140k each month for savings. If you’re not doing this yet, I suggest you start. It’s a form of investing, but with lower risk, which also means lower returns. Still, it generates some ₱₱₱\n\nCurrently, I have 1.2M in liquid savings. My traditional banks also hold several thousands (but not more than 50k each) in UB and BPI. I use UB for cash flow and BPI for car payments\n\nReaching that 1M will definitely give you a boost in motivation, but be warned, it can become quite addictive. I’m very protective of my savings since I’m the breadwinner, which means my risk appetite is practically zero. Despite wanting to invest in REITs, I simply can’t, there’s something reassuring about having readily available funds when needed\n\nIf you’re still unsure, I suggest keeping your funds liquid for now. Investing in MP2 is a good option. However, I’m personally not a fan of the fact that you can’t withdraw anytime, which is why I don’t have MP2. I prefer keeping things with digibanks. MP2 feels a bit overrated to me, and with everything going on with the government, I’m hesitant to lock my money up. This is just my opinion. For example, PhilHealth is in shambles, and I don’t find SSS reliable either, my grandfather, who was a driver, only gets 2k per month, and my deceased father, who worked in media, only receives 8K monthly for my mom’s pension\n\nI’m also considering purchasing a farm lot soon to finally have some “tangible assets” and build something for myself, as I love nature\n\nMy point is, there are other investment options you may find enjoyable in the future. The best approach is to give yourself that extra flexibility by having the funds readily available, so you can use or invest them whenever you choose 👍",

If the Index falls around 5.5k this year and you were able to buy, and in 3-5 years recovers to around 6.3k, that's 14% gain.

My mom has an HMO from her company, and I have none since I work freelance. I told myself na kung may magkasakit kahit isa samin, it will ruin us financially. So, it did.\n\nMom was diagnosed with stage 3 skin cancer last month. Her HMO covered the PET scan amounting to 70k and a minor operation. However, the immunotherapy medicine costs about 140k per session once a month. Where in the hell can I get that kind of money every month?! Naubos na yung EF ko of 40k, I saved that for almost 9 months kasi determined ako na umunlad and I learned saving EF from this sub. It took 2 days to wipe out 9 months of hard work, then hindi pa din enough to cover anything relating to my mom's treatment. I hate it. I hate this life and I don't know why it happened to us.\n\nNow, we are trying all the assistance programs that we get our hands on.

Kaya part of taking care of yourself is having emergency funds. Gawing motto yung tagline ng Clusivol dati.\n\nJust because others succeed in business ay mag sa-succeed ka na rin. Daming factors, like the type of negosyo, the location, and your own strengths. You cannot open a fashion shop in front of a school just because uso yung clothes or you want to. Base it sa needs ng customers mo. If malapit sa school, either sari2x store with school supplies o kainan. I am emphasizing school supplies sa malapit sa schools coz not all students use powerpoint. May iba na manila paper pa rin ang kanilang gamit. Example lang yun. Base it on law on supply and demand.\n\nIf may tindahan ka, do not think of expansion agad2x. Make your tindahan work really well. Work with what you have. If waka kang kasama sa buhay, forget about expanding, lalo na pag 2nd branch mo ay malayo. Bibigay yung katawan mo. We can only do as much as our body can tolerate.\n\nI will tell you yung napansin ko sa isang intsik na negosyante dito sa aming city. Yung school niya ay cheap kaya maraming nakakapag-aral. But that success of having lots of enrollees did not happen overnight. It took decades. Eventually, yung college nila was able to expand with many courses, lalo na medtech. Until such time na they could offer good pay and hire excellent talents para magturo. Not to mention na may other businesses under their group. But that is because, they are a group. Hindi yun effort ng isang tao, which is why pwede sila makakapag diversify. But that is also because they have the experience and started small. Or take the case of the Gokongweis or Samsung in South Korea. Both also started small but with experience, they diversified. Pero that is because marami silang tao para diyan. \n\nI am not saying na di mo kaya or wag mong gayahin kasi di mo kaya yung expansion or diversification kasi wala kang fam members who share your vision and ambition. What i am saying is, if may trabaho ka na pero gusto mong magnegosyo, start small. Tapos cultivate mo yung negosyo mo kahit nag-iisa lang yan.\n\nTapos do not spend needlessly just because may profit ka na. Yan ang hirap sa mga pinoy pag nakalasap ng success or profit. Pabongga here and there. Lowkey ka pa rin and invest in assets instead before ka mag splurge. Splurge once in a while, but not everytime pag may profit ka. Madaling sabihin pero mahirap gawin.\n\nYung upbringing ng simplicity dahil galing ka sa slums, bring it kahit may negosyo ka. Buti nga yung mukha kang simple pero marami kang pera.\n\nAng negosyo will take time to grow. Hindi yun agad2x. It's like growing a tree.\n\nPS: if mag-iisip ka ng expansion, make sure gumagana na talaga yung first business mo. Pero make sure na yung first business mo, may mga reliable ka na mga tauhan. Once you expand, you know na the kind of people na dapat i-hire.",

Wag yung investment apps, lugi ka dyan at minsan scam yan. Yung totoong trading sa Forex. Google mo ang Top Trading Forex apps, hanapin mo yung tumatanggap ng International, yung may Peso. Wag yung Dollars unless may Dollars ka talaga. Pero pag aralan mo muna ang Trading, maraming tutorials dyan sa youtube.\n2. Kung may lupain ka, Hacienda ba yan? Try mo mag benta ng produce mo internationally. Uso ngayon ang mga farmers na nagbebenta ng Bigas nila sa Japan at Korea. Punta ka sa Department of Trade, magtanong ka ng mga infos dun. Tanungin mo rin kung ano ang in-demand na produce na gusto ng mga Foreigners.\n3. Kung gusto mo naman ng new Job, Hanap ka ng International Job online. Yung sahod na aabot sa $4,000-$7,000. Hanapin mo yung Home based work.\n4. Na try mo ba ang Franchise tulad ng Jollibee or MacDonalds sa area mo? Check mo mga websites nila. Andun lahat ng informations nila for franchising.\n\nExtra advice:\n\nI am proud of you that you manage to rise from poverty. Ang advice ko lang sayo for building a business eh wag ka gumalaw mag isa. Isama mo mga kapatid mo sa business mo. Kung Hacienda ang business mo, hire mo ang mga kapatid mo as assistants, syempre sweldohan mo ah. Mag assign ka kung sino accountant mo, sino manager mo, sino taga bantay ng tauhan mo, etc. Kahit hindi sila tapos sa pag aaral, ang important dyan eh sila ang mas pinagkakatiwalaan mo.

A lot of comments are overly positive, ang sinasabi nila, \"just find your niche\" \"take a risk\" etc. It may seem like that being rich only involes hardwork and innovation but you have to understand, being rich through business involve a huge amount of luck. You can be the most hardworking, excellent businessman in the world, but if the opportunities aren't there, you'll just end up failing and frustrated.. Actually, most billionaires na kilala natin got successful in part due to luck din., they had the right connections at the right time. some extreme cases like billionaires daw na hnd nakapag college is a matter of luck din, they were the first to discover a certain niche that will boom in the future. But the sad reality is, most of those niches are already discovered. The market is already saturated by services and products that a single search of something you need on google, chances are meron na gumagawa nun. Business is a huge risk and if may balak ka, you need to save up a big amount of money as buffer just in case that it will fail. IMO, the safest route and still get good returns in the future is investing through US index funds, bonds, high yield savings accounts. minsan nga mas maganda pa returns dun compared so other business minus yung sakit ng ulo.",

For example, I created clear processes for hiring, firing, and scaling, so emotions don’t get in the way.

    "body": "Grabe, 2024 talaga, puno ng life lessons - yung tipong minsan masakit, minsan nakakagising. Napaisip ako kung paano gumastos, mag-ipon, at kumayod nang mas maayos. Natutunan ko rin na minsan, yung simple skills at boring na trabaho, sila pala yung malaking kitaan. Eto mga napulot ko, para hindi mo na pagdaanan.\n\n* **Inflation is Everywhere** (Even in Your Timplado Coffee). It’s not just the grocery bills - 2024 showed me inflation is a sneaky little thief. Yung Andok's Dokito Burger na dati ₱70 lang, aba ₱100 na ngayon! It got so bad, even my favorite fast food “cheat meals” started feeling premium. I had to track everything—from Shopee add-to-cart moments to random late-night snacks - kasi bigla nalang ako nagugulat na paubos na pala ang budget ko for the month.\n* **Procrastination is the Real Wallet Killer** \\- Ayan, I learned this the hard way. Naalala ko yung sirang aircon namin—akala ko kaya pa, so deadma muna. Two weeks later, it fully gave up... during a heatwave. Napilitang bumili ng bago on the spot sa mahal na. That’s when I realized, yung \"later\" na iniisip mo, mas nagiging expensive now. Whether it’s overdue bills or investments you’re delaying, mas mahal ang epekto in the long run.\n* **Learning Skills is the New Emergency Fund** \\- 2024 humbled me. I realized savings lang aren’t enough when life hits you hard. Kaya natutunan ko na mag-side gig sa business ng kapatid ko tuwing weekends, para at least may backup ako. A friend of mine learned how to install solar panels para maging freelance installer. It doesn’t have to be complicated, pero having a new skill gives you options - and options are everything when the bills come knocking.\n* **Cheap Stuff Ends Up More Expensive** \\- Okay, confession: I bought this unknown brand laptop from Shopee kasi gusto ko makatipid. Three months later, sira na. Napilitang bumili ng mas reliable na unit, so doble pa ang nagastos ko. Lesson learned? Not everything na “mura” is worth it. Shoes, gadgets, even home appliances - if you go for quality upfront, you’ll save yourself the headache and surprise gastos.\n* **Who You Know is Your Secret Weapon** \\-  One casual convo with a friend ended up doubling my income this year. They recommended me for a freelance gig that I didn’t even think I could do! 2024 reminded me na networking isn’t just for big-shot businessmen. It’s about staying open, building connections, and being helpful to people—you never know where it can take you.\n\n**Bonus Tip**\n\nNapansin ko rin na yung mga seemingly \"boring\" professions, malaki pala ang kita. Yung pinsan ko na HVAC technician (yung nag-aayos ng aircon at ref), kumikita ng ₱30,000-₱50,000 sa freelance work para sa mga restaurants. Doon ko lang nalaman na in-demand pala and may shortage tayo ng HVAC technicians. Sometimes, the less glamorous jobs are the ones that pay well.",

    "body": "First of all, I'd like to thank this sub and everyone who contributes to it. Even being a casual lurker, I picked up a lot of advice and guidance which I attribute to my success now and in the future. \n\n# How I did it\n\nThe general advice for youngsters like myself is to start by investing in ourselves. Investing in things like stocks and real estate wasn't viable for me because like most teens, I didn't have the capital required to make significant returns. So with all the free time in the world and the collective knowledge of the internet at my fingertips, I invested in myself by learning.\n\n>First, you learn. Then you remove the 'L'.\n\nAt first, I'd learn about budgeting, investing, finance, trading, cryptocurrencies, and whatnot. These things are useful to learn, but I didn't get anywhere because I couldn't apply them to real life without having a proper cash flow. It dawned on me that I would either have to start a business or get a job.\n\nI tried bitcoin mining with a friend, selling bike parts and upgrades, crypto trading with my savings, and investing in axie, all with returns that were not worth the effort. The only thing that only paid off was my learning about web development.\n\n>Don't half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing.\n\nAmidst all my failed business ventures, I spent more than a year upskilling myself in web development. After all the defeats, I had one more backup plan, which was to try and sell my time and skills instead of selling products or exploiting the markets. \n\nI focused on web development 100%, learning only through free online resources like [Harvard's CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0), [The Odin Project,](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and youtube. and by the end of this July, I got offered a permanent web development job compensating in USD, and that is where I get the majority of my 99k a month. The rest is from allowances and investments.\n\n# My Next Steps\n\n**Building upon my Emergency Fund.** My first step is to save up 6 months' worth of my income to my EF.\n\n**Increasing my Job Security**. While I'm building my EF, it'll give me time to focus on becoming more valuable to the company and less dispensable. Maybe I can also get a promotion/pay raise during these 6 months.\n\n**Building a side-hustle.** Others might suggest that I first invest in safe vehicles like index funds and whatnot, but I have zero financial obligations and a lot of capital, so it's safe for me to take risks and possibly reap high rewards. I'm thinking a money lending business would be a great fit for me.\n\n**Investing externally.** After I've built a profitable side-hustle, I'll start investing in Stocks, Crypto, and Real Estate. \n\n**Investing in myself (again).** A man only needs three things in life: Wealth, Health, and Happiness. I've got a little wealth in my hands, so I'll continue working and investing more into the other two.\n\n**Living my life.** I'm not one to splurge on materialistic things anymore. I think I'll spend my free time and money on experiences with friends and families. I'm still in my physical prime, so I think I'll do a lot of traveling.\n\n# In Conclusion\n\nIf you already have a laptop and an Internet connection, all you need now is a willingness to learn and the motivation to chase your dreams. Sure, I might have had luck on my side, and I do not deny that. But it shouldn't stop you from trying to shoot your shot. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\n\nI am not smart, nor am I talented; I just had the luck of stumbling upon this sub it took me most of the way here. You can find all the answers on the Internet if you look hard enough.\n\nI wish you all the luck in the world. Now let's get this bread!",

    "body": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/09/Screenshot_20240927-140301.png\n\nI’m sure many have seen the PSA’s FIES report, which defines income classes and includes percentages of the population falling into each income class. \n\nHere’s the full report:\nhttps://psa.gov.ph/statistics/income-expenditure/fies\n\nRappler also released an article referencing the study, headlining that 25k/month gets you to the middle class:\nhttps://www.rappler.com/business/middle-class-philippines-pids-study/\n\nMany people in the main PH sub reacted negatively to this article, expecting that middle-class means a decent life just like what it implies in a first-world setting. But middle class just really means you’re in the middle - 65M Filipinos (60%) live on less than 25k per month, 45M live on more than 25k per month, so that’s pretty middle if you ask me. True median (50th percentile) is about 20k/month.\n\nNow using the data from that table, you can also derive that only 3% of Filipino households earn over 100k per month. Despite what the impression of this sub gives, the reality is that when looking at the bigger picture, “6-digit” earners are a small minority of total PH population. Do note though that 3% is still 3 million people, so it’s still a lot. A few other data points:\n\n- Top 10%: At least 60k/month\n- Top 1%: At least 150k/month\n- Top 0.3%: At least 240k/month\n\nFull percentile computations:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WtJtE5K.jpeg\n\nWhat does this mean? If you think this sub is full of alleged 6-digit earners, remember that they’re only a small minority of the population, and it’s either it’s a noisy minority, or just many LARPers who like to pretend they earn at that level.\n\nThat said, it doesn’t change the fact that even at 100k/month, it’s possible that you still won’t feel rich in the Philippines, even if you’re already richer than 97% of the population. After all, even by FIES’ definition, 100k is only upper-middle income. But at the very least, you can be grateful that you have it better than most.\n",

Tapos maririnig ko na yun big corporations maglalagay lang ng suhol para hindi sila magbayad ng tamang tax.

What do I get paying that absurd amount sa government? Wala. Walang free public transpo, walang free healthcare, walang free infrastructure na pwedeng gamitin for work or recreation (specially sa mga rural provinces) and walang ring channels that can help me find freelance jobs. Wala. Lahat sariling kayod at diskarte. Masaklap pa, no immediate laws in place that protects freelancers.\n\nAlso have you tried paying voluntary sa BIR? Napaka hirap and you have to spend half a day to process it. Wala rin silang online web platform kung saan pwede mo makita contributions or handle payment. And if meron man, they need to put instructions and update their 1990s website. Jusko!\n\nPay for what you think the government deserves.",

I got into videography months ago, i’m often advised by the guy i work with (i call him boss) that do not cheat on your earnings even if you just started, the 20% tax deduct it immediately from your pay. Don’t think too much how to lessen it just deduct the 20% first so when tax season comes you have all money to pay. Less headache in the future. Otherwise, it would become a habit, a bad habit.",
